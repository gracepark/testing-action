name: No Response

# **What it does**: Closes issues that don't have enough information to be
#                   actionable.
# **Why we have it**: To remove the need for maintainers to remember to check
#                     back on issues periodically to see if contributors have
#                     responded.
# **Who does it impact**: Everyone that works on docs or docs-internal.
