# Signing in with a passkey

You can use a passkey to sign in safely and easily to GitHub.com, without requiring a password and two-factor authentication. You can also sign in using a passkey on a nearby device.

**Who can use this feature**: Personal account owners who manage their own credentials can authenticate to GitHub.com using passkeys.

## About signing in with a passkey

You must first add a passkey to your account before you can use the passkey to sign in to GitHub.com. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey/managing-your-passkeys)."

Once you have added a passkey to your account, you can use the passkey to sign in safely and securely to GitHub.com without having to enter your password or perform two-factor authentication (2FA). Once you have added a synced passkey on one device, the passkey is available to use across multiple devices. These devices must use the same passkey provider (such as iCloud).

Some authenticators allow passkeys to be used with nearby devices. For example, perhaps you want to sign in to GitHub.com using a bluetooth-enabled laptop that's not set up with a passkey. If you have registered a passkey on your phone, you might opt to scan a QR code, or trigger a push notification to your phone, in order to complete the sign in securely. For more information, see "[Signing in with a passkey using a nearby device](#signing-in-with-a-passkey-using-a-nearby-device)."
