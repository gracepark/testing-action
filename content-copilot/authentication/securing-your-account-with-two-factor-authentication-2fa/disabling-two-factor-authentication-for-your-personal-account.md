# Disabling two-factor authentication for your personal account

If you disable two-factor authentication for your personal account, you may lose access to organizations you belong to.

We strongly recommend using two-factor authentication to secure your account. If you need to disable 2FA, we recommend re-enabling it as soon as possible.

**Warning:** If you're a member, billing manager, or outside collaborator to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication and you disable 2FA, you'll be automatically removed from the organization, and you'll lose your access to their repositories. To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.

If your organization requires two-factor authentication and you're a member, owner, or an outside collaborator on a private repository of your organization, you must first leave your organization before you can disable two-factor authentication.

To remove yourself from your organization:
- As an organization member or owner, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/removing-yourself-from-an-organization)."
- As an outside collaborator, ask an organization owner or repository administrator to remove you from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/viewing-peoples-roles-in-an-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/removing-an-outside-collaborator-from-an-organization-repository)."
