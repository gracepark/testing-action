# Viewing packages

You can see details about packages published to a repository, and narrow results by organization or user.

**Who can use this feature**: You must have at least read permissions to view a package.

GitHub Packages is available with GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 or higher, and GitHub AE.

<br>GitHub Packages is not available for private repositories owned by accounts using legacy per-repository plans. Also, accounts using legacy per-repository plans cannot access registries that support granular permissions, because these accounts are billed by repository. For the list of registries that support granular permissions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)." For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

## About package views

Your ability to view a package depends on several factors. By default, you can view all packages you have published.

Packages inherit their permissions and visibility from the repository on which they are hosted. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages)."

On the package page, GitHub provides metadata for each version, such as the publication date. You can see details about the package, including a description and installation and usage instructions. You can download any assets associated with the package and see information about download activity. For an example package page, see [@Codertocat/hello-world-npm](https://github.com/Codertocat/hello-world-npm/packages/10696?version=1.0.1).
