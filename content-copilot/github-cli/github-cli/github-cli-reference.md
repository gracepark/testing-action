# GitHub CLI reference

You can view all of the GitHub CLI commands in your terminal. The same information is available in the GitHub CLI manual.

To view all top-level GitHub CLI commands, enter `gh` without arguments.

```shell
gh
```

To list all of the subcommands that you can use with a GitHub CLI command, use the top-level command without arguments.

```shell
gh COMMAND
```

For example, to view the environment variables that you can set to affect certain aspects of GitHub CLI, use the `environment` command.

```shell
gh environment
```

To view the configuration settings that you can set, use the `config` command.

```shell
gh config
```

To view help for a particular subcommand, use the `--help` flag.

```shell
gh COMMAND [SUBCOMMAND ...] --help
```

All of the information that's available by running these commands in the terminal is also included in the [GitHub CLI online manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh).
