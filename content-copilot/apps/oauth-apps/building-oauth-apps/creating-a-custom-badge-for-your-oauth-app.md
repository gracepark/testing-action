# Creating a custom badge for your OAuth app

You can replace the default badge on your OAuth app by uploading your own logo image and customizing the background.

By default, a new OAuth app will have an automatically generated [identicon](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons).
An identicon badge looks something like this:

After you create an OAuth app, you can customize the app's badge by uploading a logo and selecting a background color. A badge is a square logo image inside of a circular badge. You can choose a background color for the badge, which can be used to visually distinguish your app.

Your logo should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend an image size of at least 200px x 200px. See "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/writing-a-listing-description-for-your-app#guidelines-for-logos)" for more guidance on customizing badges.

You can change a custom badge for a GitHub App that already has an approved Marketplace listing by navigating to https://github.com/marketplace/manage.

To create a custom badge:

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
