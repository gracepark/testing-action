Before listing an app on GitHub Marketplace, you should follow the best practices for the type of app that you are listing:

- "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/best-practices-for-creating-a-github-app)"
- "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/best-practices-for-creating-an-oauth-app)"

Additionally, you should have the capability to notify GitHub within 24 hours of a confirmed security incident.

In addition to following security best practices, you should also follow customer experience best practices. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/customer-experience-best-practices-for-apps)."
