# About GitHub Marketplace for apps

Learn about GitHub Marketplace where you can share your apps publicly with all GitHub users.

[GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) connects you to developers who want to extend and improve their GitHub workflows. You can list free and paid tools for developers to use in GitHub Marketplace. GitHub Marketplace offers developers two types of tools: GitHub Actions and Apps, and each tool requires different steps for adding it to GitHub Marketplace.

## GitHub Actions

Anyone can publish an action in GitHub Marketplace. GitHub verifies some partner organizations and these are shown as verified creators.

To learn about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace)."

## Apps

Anyone can share their apps with other users for free on GitHub Marketplace but only apps owned by organizations can sell their app.

To publish paid plans for your app and display a marketplace badge, you must complete the publisher verification process. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app)."

Once the organization meets the requirements, someone with owner permissions in the organization can publish paid plans for any of their apps. Each app with a paid plan also goes through a financial onboarding process to enable payments.

To publish apps with free plans, you only need to meet the general requirements for listing any app. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app#requirements-for-all-github-marketplace-listings)."

### New to apps?

If you're interested in creating an app for GitHub Marketplace, but you're new to GitHub Apps or OAuth apps, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps)."

### GitHub Apps vs. OAuth apps

GitHub Apps are the officially recommended way to integrate with GitHub because they offer much more granular permissions to access data, although you can list both OAuth and GitHub Apps in GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/migrating-oauth-apps-to-github-apps)."

## Publishing an app to GitHub Marketplace overview

When you have finished creating your app, you can share it with other users by publishing it to GitHub Marketplace. In summary, the process is:

1. Review your app carefully to ensure that it will behave as expected in other repositories and that it follows best practice guidelines. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps-on-github-marketplace)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app#best-practice-for-customer-experience)."

1. Add webhook events to the app to track user billing requests. For more information about the GitHub Marketplace API, webhook events, and billing requests, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app)."

1. Create a draft GitHub Marketplace listing. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/drafting-a-listing-for-your-app)."

1. Add a pricing plan. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing)."

1. Read and accept the terms of the "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-marketplace-developer-agreement)."

1. Submit your listing for publication in GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/submitting-your-listing-for-publication)."
