# Applying for publisher verification for your organization

To offer paid plans for your app or to include a marketplace badge in your app listing, you must complete the publisher verification process for your organization.

**Note:** This article applies to publishing GitHub Apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace)."

</div>

Publisher verification ensures that GitHub has a way to contact you, that you've enabled two-factor authentication for your organization, and that your organization's domain has been verified.

Once your organization has been verified, you can publish paid plans for your app. For information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing)."

To offer paid plans for your app, the app must be owned by an organization and you must have owner permissions in the organization. If your app is currently owned by a personal account, you'll need to transfer the ownership of the app to an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/transferring-ownership-of-an-oauth-app)."
