# Transferring ownership of a GitHub App

You can transfer ownership of a GitHub App registration to another user or organization.

## About transferring GitHub Apps

The owner of a GitHub App registration can transfer ownership of the GitHub App registration to another user or organization. If an organization has designated any app managers for an app owned by the organization, the app managers can also transfer ownership of the GitHub App registration. For more information about app managers, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/adding-and-removing-github-app-managers-in-your-organization)."

You can only transfer ownership to a user or organization. You cannot transfer ownership to a team.
