## About deleting GitHub Apps

If you own a GitHub App or are an app manager for a GitHub App, you can delete the GitHub App registration. For more information about GitHub App managers, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/about-github-app-managers)."

When you delete a GitHub App registration, the app will be uninstalled from all accounts that the app is installed on.

**Note**: If your GitHub App is published on GitHub Marketplace, you must contact GitHub Support and ask them to remove your app from GitHub Marketplace before you can delete your app. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/deleting-your-github-app-listing-from-github-marketplace)."
