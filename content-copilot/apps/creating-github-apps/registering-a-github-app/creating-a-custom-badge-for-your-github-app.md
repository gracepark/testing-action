# Creating a custom badge for your GitHub App

You can replace the default badge on your GitHub App by uploading your own logo image and customizing the background.

## About badges

Every GitHub App has a badge. A badge is a square image inside a circular background.

By default, a new GitHub App will use an automatically generated identicon as a badge. An identicon badge looks something like this:

After you register a GitHub App, you can customize your app's badge by uploading a logo and selecting a background color. Your logo should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend an image dimension of 200 pixels by 200 pixels.

You can change a custom badge for a GitHub App that already has an approved Marketplace listing by navigating to https://github.com/marketplace/manage.
