# Installing your own GitHub App

You can install a GitHub App that you created on the personal or organization account that owns the app. If your app is public, the GitHub App can also be installed on other accounts.

## About installing your own GitHub App

Once you create a GitHub App, you can install it. If your GitHub App is owned by a personal account, you can install it on your account. If your GitHub App is owned by an organization and you are an organization owner, you can install it on the organization.

If your GitHub App is public, you can also share your GitHub App with other users or organizations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/sharing-your-github-app)."
