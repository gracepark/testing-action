## About re-running workflows and jobs

Re-running a workflow uses the same `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run. You can re-run a workflow for up to 30 days after the initial run.

To re-run a failed workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the failed run that you want to re-run.  If you don't specify a `run-id`, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID
```

To view the progress of the workflow run, use the `run watch` subcommand and select the run from the interactive list.

```shell
gh run watch
```
