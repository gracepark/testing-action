# Downloading workflow artifacts

You can download archived artifacts before they automatically expire.

**Who can use this feature**: People who are signed into GitHub and have read access to a repository can download workflow artifacts.
 
By default, GitHub stores build logs and artifacts for 90 days, and you can customize this retention period, depending on the type of repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-repository)."

Read access to the repository is required to perform these steps.

GitHub CLI will download each artifact into separate directories based on the artifact name. If only a single artifact is specified, it will be extracted into the current directory.

To download all artifacts generated by a workflow run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. If you don't specify a `run-id`, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID
```

To download a specific artifact from a run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. Replace `artifact-name` with the name of the artifact that you want to download.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID -n ARTIFACT_NAME
```

You can specify more than one artifact.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID> -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 -n ARTIFACT_NAME-2
```

To download specific artifacts across all runs in a repository, use the `run download` subcommand.

```shell
gh run download -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 ARTIFACT_NAME-2
```
