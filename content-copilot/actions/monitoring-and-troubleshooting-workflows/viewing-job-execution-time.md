# Viewing job execution time

You can view the execution time of a job, including the billable minutes that a job accrued.

Billable job execution minutes are only shown for jobs run on private repositories that use GitHub-hosted runners and are rounded up to the next minute. There are no billable minutes when using GitHub Actions in public repositories or for jobs run on self-hosted runners.
