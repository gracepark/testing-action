# Using workflow run logs

You can view, search, and download the logs for each job in a workflow run.

You can see whether a workflow run is in progress or complete from the workflow run page. You must be logged in to a GitHub account to view workflow run information, including for public repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github)."

If the run is complete, you can see whether the result was a success, failure, canceled, or neutral. If the run failed, you can view and search the build logs to diagnose the failure and re-run the workflow. You can also view billable job execution minutes, or download logs and build artifacts.

GitHub Actions use the Checks API to output statuses, results, and logs for a workflow. GitHub creates a new check suite for each workflow run. The check suite contains a check run for each job in the workflow, and each job includes steps. GitHub Actions are run as a step in a workflow. For more information about the Checks API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/checks)."

**Note:** Ensure that you only commit valid workflow files to your repository. If `.github/workflows` contains an invalid workflow file, GitHub Actions generates a failed workflow run for every new commit.

</div>

## Viewing logs to diagnose failures

If your workflow run fails, you can see which step caused the failure and review the failed step's build logs to troubleshoot. You can see the time it took for each step to run. You can also copy a permalink to a specific line in the log file to share with your team. Read access to the repository is required to perform these steps.

In addition to the steps configured in the workflow file, GitHub adds two additional steps to each job to set up and complete the job's execution. These steps are logged in the workflow run with the names "Set up job" and "Complete job".

For jobs run on GitHub-hosted runners, "Set up job" records details of the runner image, and includes a link to the list of preinstalled tools that were present on the runner machine.

## Deleting logs

You can delete the log files from your workflow runs through the GitHub web interface or programmatically. Write access to the repository is required to perform these steps.

### Deleting logs via the GitHub web interface

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-play" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M8 0a8 8 0 1 1 0 16A8 8 0 0 1 8 0ZM1.5 8a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 13 0 6.5 6.5 0 0 0-13 0Zm4.879-2.773 4.264 2.559a.25.25 0 0 1 0 .428l-4.264 2.559A.25.25 0 0 1 6 10.559V5.442a.25.25 0 0 1 .379-.215Z"></path></svg> **Actions**.

   ![Screenshot of the tabs for the "github/docs" repository. The "Actions" tab is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-tab.png)

1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

   ![Screenshot of the left sidebar of the "Actions" tab. A workflow, "CodeQL," is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/superlinter-workflow-sidebar.png)
1. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run to see the workflow run summary.
1. In the upper-right corner, select the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Show workflow options" role="img"><path d="M8 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3ZM1.5 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Zm13 0a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Z"></path></svg> dropdown menu, then click **Delete all logs**.

    ![Screenshot of the page for a workflow run. In the top-right corner, a button, labeled with a kebab icon, is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/workflow-run-kebab-horizontal-icon.png)

1. Review the confirmation prompt.

After deleting logs, the **Delete all logs** button is removed to indicate that no log files remain in the workflow run.

### Deleting logs programmatically

You can use the following script to automatically delete all logs for a workflow. This can be a useful way to clean up logs for multiple workflow runs.

To run the example script below:

1. Copy the code example and save it to a file called `delete-logs.sh`.
1. Grant it the execute permission with `chmod +x delete-logs.sh`.
1. Run the following command, where `REPOSITORY_NAME` is the name of your repository and `WORKFLOW_NAME` is the file name of your workflow.

    ```shell copy
    ./delete-logs.sh REPOSITORY_NAME WORKFLOW_NAME
    ```

    For example, to delete all of the logs in the `monalisa/octocat` repository for the `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` workflow, you would run `./delete-logs.sh monalisa/octocat ci.yaml`.

#### Example script

```bash copy
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Delete all logs for a given workflow
# Usage: delete-logs.sh <repository> <workflow-name>

set -oe pipefail

REPOSITORY=$1
WORKFLOW_NAME=$2

# Validate arguments
if [[ -z "$REPOSITORY" ]]; then
  echo "Repository is required"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ -z "$WORKFLOW_NAME" ]]; then
  echo "Workflow name is required"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Getting all completed runs for workflow $WORKFLOW_NAME in $REPOSITORY"

RUNS=$(
  gh api \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
    "/repos/$REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/$WORKFLOW_NAME/runs" \
    --paginate \
    --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.conclusion != "") | .id'
)

echo "Found $(echo "$RUNS" | wc -l) completed runs for workflow $WORKFLOW_NAME"

# Delete logs for each run
for RUN in $RUNS; do
  echo "Deleting logs for run $RUN"
  gh api \
    --silent \
    --method DELETE \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
    "/repos/$REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$RUN/logs" || echo "Failed to delete logs for run $RUN"

  # Sleep for 100ms to avoid rate limiting
  sleep 0.1
done
```

## Viewing logs with GitHub CLI

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see "[AUTOTITLE](/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli)."

</div>

To view the log for a specific job, use the `run view` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of run that you want to view logs for. GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run. If you don't specify `run-id`, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run, and then returns another interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run.

```shell
gh run view RUN_ID --log
```

You can also use the `--job` flag to specify a job ID. Replace `job-id` with the ID of the job that you want to view logs for.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log
```

You can use `grep` to search the log. For example, this command will return all log entries that contain the word `error`.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log | grep error
```

To filter the logs for any failed steps, use `--log-failed` instead of `--log`.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log-failed
```
