# Adding self-hosted runners

You can add a self-hosted runner to a repository, an organization, or an enterprise.

You can add a self-hosted runner to a repository, an organization, or an enterprise.

If you are an organization or enterprise administrator, you might want to add your self-hosted runners at the organization or enterprise level. This approach makes the runner available to multiple repositories in your organization or enterprise, and also lets you to manage your runners in one place.

For information on supported operating systems for self-hosted runners, or using self-hosted runners with a proxy server, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-warning border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-danger-emphasis color-bg-danger">

**Warning:** We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security-with-public-repositories)."

</div>

You can set up automation to scale the number of self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners)."

## Prerequisites

- You must have access to the machine you will use as a self-hosted runner in your environment.

-  For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#communication-between-self-hosted-runners-and-github-ae)."

## Adding a self-hosted runner to a repository

You can add self-hosted runners to a single repository. To add a self-hosted runner to a user repository, you must be the repository owner. For an organization repository, you must be an organization owner or have admin access to the repository. For information about how to add a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions#self-hosted-runners)."

1. You will see instructions showing you how to download the runner application and install it on your self-hosted runner machine.

   Open a shell on your self-hosted runner machine and run each shell command in the order shown.

   <div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

   **Note:** On Windows, if you want to install the self-hosted runner application as a service, you must open a shell with administrator privileges. We also recommend that you use `C:\actions-runner` as the directory for the self-hosted runner application so that Windows system accounts can access the runner directory.

   </div>

   The instructions walk you through completing these tasks:
   - Downloading and extracting the self-hosted runner application.
   - Running the `config` script to configure the self-hosted runner application and register it with GitHub Actions. The `config` script requires the destination URL and an automatically-generated time-limited token to authenticate the request.
     - On Windows, the `config` script also asks if you would like to install the self-hosted runner application as a service. For Linux and macOS, you can install a service after you finish adding the runner. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service)."
   - Running the self-hosted runner application to connect the machine to GitHub Actions.

### Checking that your self-hosted runner was successfully added

After completing the steps to add a self-hosted runner, the runner and its status are now listed under "Runners".

The self-hosted runner application must be active for the runner to accept jobs. When the runner application is connected to GitHub and ready to receive jobs, you will see the following message on the machine's terminal.

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an organization

You can add self-hosted runners at the organization level, where they can be used to process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization. To add a self-hosted runner to an organization, you must be an organization owner.

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an enterprise

If you use GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can add self-hosted runners to an enterprise, where they can be assigned to multiple organizations. The organization owner can control which repositories can use it. For more information, see the [GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-enterprise).
