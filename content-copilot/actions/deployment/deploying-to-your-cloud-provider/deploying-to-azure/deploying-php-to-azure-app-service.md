# Deploying PHP to Azure App Service

You can deploy your PHP project to Azure App Service as part of your continuous deployment (CD) workflows.

## Introduction

This guide explains how to use GitHub Actions to build and deploy a PHP project to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/).

**Note**: 
If your GitHub Actions workflows need to access resources from a cloud provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC), you can configure your workflows to authenticate directly to the cloud provider. This will let you stop storing these credentials as long-lived secrets and provide other security benefits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure)."

## Prerequisites

Before creating your GitHub Actions workflow, you will first need to complete the following setup steps:

1. Create an Azure App Service plan.

   For example, you can use the Azure CLI to create a new App Service plan:

   ```bash copy
   az appservice plan create \
      --resource-group MY_RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN \
      --is-linux
   ```

   In the command above, replace `MY_RESOURCE_GROUP` with your pre-existing Azure Resource Group, and `MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN` with a new name for the App Service plan.

   See the Azure documentation for more information on using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/):

   - For authentication, see "[Sign in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)."
   - If you need to create a new resource group, see "[az group](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_create)."

1. Create a web app.

   For example, you can use the Azure CLI to create an Azure App Service web app with a PHP runtime:

   ```bash copy
   az webapp create \
       --name MY_WEBAPP_NAME \
       --plan MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN \
       --resource-group MY_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --runtime "php|7.4"
   ```

   In the command above, replace the parameters with your own values, where `MY_WEBAPP_NAME` is a new name for the web app.

1. Configure an Azure publish profile and create an `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` secret.

   Generate your Azure deployment credentials using a publish profile. For more information, see "[Generate deployment credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials)" in the Azure documentation.

   In your GitHub repository, create a secret named `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` that contains the contents of the publish profile. For more information on creating secrets, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)."

1. Optionally, configure a deployment environment. Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`. When a GitHub Actions workflow deploys to an environment, the environment is displayed on the main page of the repository. You can use environments to require approval for a job to proceed, restrict which branches can trigger a workflow, or limit access to secrets. For more information about creating environments, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

## Creating the workflow

Once you've completed the prerequisites, you can proceed with creating the workflow.

The following example workflow demonstrates how to build and deploy a PHP project to Azure App Service when there is a push to the `main` branch.

Ensure that you set `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` in the workflow `env` key to the name of the web app you created. If the path to your project is not the repository root, change `AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH` to the path to your project. If you use a version of PHP other than `8.x`, change`PHP_VERSION` to the version that you use.

If you configured a deployment environment, change the value of `environment` to be the name of your environment. If you did not configure an environment or if your workflow is in a private repository and you do not use GitHub Enterprise Cloud, delete the `environment` key.

```yaml copy
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.
