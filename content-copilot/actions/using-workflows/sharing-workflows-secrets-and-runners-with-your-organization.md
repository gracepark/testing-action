# Sharing workflows, secrets, and runners with your organization

Learn how you can use organization features to collaborate with your team, by sharing starter workflows, secrets, and self-hosted runners.

## Overview

If you need to share workflows and other GitHub Actions features with your team, then consider collaborating within a GitHub organization. An organization allows you to centrally store and manage secrets, artifacts, and self-hosted runners. You can also create starter workflows in the `.github` repository and share them with other users in your organization.

## Sharing workflows

Your organization can share workflows by reusing the workflows exactly or by creating starter workflows that provide templates for new workflows.

### Reusing workflows

 You can call one workflow from within another workflow. This allows you to reuse workflows, avoiding duplication and making your workflows easier to maintain. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)."

### Using starter workflows

Starter workflows allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When you create a new workflow, you can choose a starter workflow and some or all of the work of writing the workflow will be done for you. You can use starter workflows as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is. This not only saves time, it promotes consistency and best practice across your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)."

## Sharing secrets within an organization

You can centrally manage your secrets  within an organization, and then make them available to selected repositories. This also means that you can update a secret  in one location, and have the change apply to all repository workflows that use it.

When creating a secret  in an organization, you can use a policy to limit which repositories can access it. For example, you can grant access to all repositories, or limit access to only private repositories or a specified list of repositories.

To create secrets at the organization level, you must be an organization owner.

## Share self-hosted runners within an organization

Organization owners can add their self-hosted runners to groups, and then create policies that control which repositories can access the group.
