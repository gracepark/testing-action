**Tip**: If a repository has any protected branches, you can't edit or upload files in the protected branch using GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)."

You can use GitHub Desktop to move your changes to a new branch and commit them. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop)."

## Editing files in another user's repository

When you edit a file in another user's repository, we'll automatically [fork the repository](/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [open a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for you.

1. In another user's repository, browse to the folder that contains the file you want to edit. Click the name of the file you want to edit.
