# Backing up a repository

You can use the API or a third-party tool to back up your repository.

To download an archive of your repository, you can use the API for user or organization migrations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/migrations)."

Once you have downloaded your archive, you can copy it to an external hard drive and/or upload it to a cloud-based backup or storage service such as [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/dropbox).

## Third-party backup tools

A number of self-service tools exist that automate backups of repositories. Unlike archival projects, which archive _all_ public repositories on GitHub that have not opted out and make the data accessible to anyone, backup tools will download data from _specific_ repositories and organize it within a new branch or directory. For more information about archival projects, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/about-archiving-content-and-data-on-github#about-the-github-archive-program)." For more information about self-service backup tools, see the [Backup Utilities category on GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=backup-utilities).
