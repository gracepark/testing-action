# Referencing and citing content

You can use third-party tools to cite and reference content on GitHub.

## Issuing a persistent identifier for your repository with Zenodo

To make your repositories easier to reference in academic literature, you can create persistent identifiers, also known as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). You can use the data archiving tool [Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) to archive a repository on GitHub.com and issue a DOI for the archive.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tips:**
- Zenodo can only access public repositories, so make sure the repository you want to archive is [public](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility).
- If you want to archive a repository that belongs to an organization, the organization owner may need to [approve access](/organizations/managing-oauth-access-to-your-organizations-data/approving-oauth-apps-for-your-organization) for the Zenodo application.
- Make sure to include a [license](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) in your repository so readers know how they can reuse your work.

Zenodo archives your repository and issues a new DOI each time you create a new GitHub [release](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases). Follow the steps at "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)" to create a new one.
