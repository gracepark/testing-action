People with read access to a repository can see an overview of all current deployments and a log of past deployment activity, if the repository's deployment workflow is integrated with GitHub through the Deployments API or an app from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/category/deployment). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/repos#deployments)."

You can also see deployment information on the "Conversation" tab of a pull request.

## Viewing the deployments dashboard

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
