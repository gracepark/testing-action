# Viewing traffic to a repository

Anyone with push access to a repository can view its traffic, including full clones (not fetches), visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content in the traffic graph.

This repository insights graph is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "[About repository graphs](/articles/about-repository-graphs)" and "[GitHub's products](/articles/github-s-products)."

You can navigate to referring sites, excluding search engines and GitHub itself, from the links the specific paths were referred from. The popular content links to the specific content that generated traffic.

Referring sites and popular content are ordered by views and unique visitors. Full clones and visitor information update hourly, while referring sites and popular content sections update daily. All data in the traffic graph uses the UTC+0 timezone, regardless of your location.

**Tip:** You can hover over a specific day in the traffic graph to view the exact data for that day.
