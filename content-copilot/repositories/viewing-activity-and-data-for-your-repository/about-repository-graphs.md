# About repository graphs

Repository graphs help you view and analyze data for your repository.

A repository's graphs give you information on  traffic, projects that depend on the repository, contributors and commits to the repository, and a repository's forks and network. If you maintain a repository, you can use this data to get a better understanding of who's using your repository and why they're using it.

Some repository graphs are available only in public repositories with GitHub Free:
- Pulse
- Contributors
- Traffic
- Commits
- Code frequency
- Network

All other repository graphs are available in all repositories. Every repository graph is available in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."
