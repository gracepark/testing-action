# Using Pulse to view a summary of repository activity

You can use Pulse to see an overview of a repository's pull request, issue, and commit activity.

This repository insights graph is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/about-repository-graphs)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

## About Pulse

You can view an overview of a repository's activity through Pulse. Pulse includes a list of open and merged pull requests, open and closed issues, and a graph showing the commit activity for the top 15 users who committed to the default branch of the project in the selected [time period](/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-a-summary-of-repository-activity#filtering-by-time).

Commit co-authors are included in the commit activity summary if their commits were merged into the repository's default branch and they're in the top 15 users who have contributed the most commits.
