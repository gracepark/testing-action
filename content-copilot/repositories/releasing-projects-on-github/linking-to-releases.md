# Linking to releases

You can share every release you create on GitHub with a unique URL.

## Linking to the latest release

You can share a link to the latest release for a repository by adding `releases/latest` to the end of a repository's URL. For example, the URL for the latest release of `octo-org/octo-repo` on GitHub.com is `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/latest`.

To link directly to a download of your latest release asset that was manually uploaded, the suffix is `/releases/latest/download/asset-name.zip`.

## Linking to older releases

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. To the right of the list of files, click **Releases**.
