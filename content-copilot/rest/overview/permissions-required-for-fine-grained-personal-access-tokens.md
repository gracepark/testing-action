## About permissions required for fine-grained personal access token

When you create a fine-grained personal access token, you grant it a set of permissions. Permissions define what resources the GitHub App can access via the API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)."

Some endpoints require additional permissions. When this is the case, the "Additional permissions" column will indicate the other permissions that are required to use the endpoint.
