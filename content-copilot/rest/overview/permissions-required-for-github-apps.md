# Permissions required for GitHub Apps

These are the permissions required for a GitHub App to use each REST API endpoint that works with GitHub Apps.

## About GitHub App permissions

GitHub Apps are created with a set of permissions. Permissions define what resources the GitHub App can access via the API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/setting-permissions-for-github-apps)."

Some endpoints require additional permissions. When this is the case, the "Additional permissions" column will indicate the other permissions that are required to use the endpoint.
