# Check Suites

Use the REST API to manage check suites.

  **Note:** A GitHub App usually only receives one [`check_suite`](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#check_suite) event per commit SHA, even if you push the commit SHA to more than one branch. To find out when a commit SHA is pushed to a branch, you can subscribe to branch [`create`](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#create) events.
