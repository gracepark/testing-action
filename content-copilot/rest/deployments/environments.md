## About deployment environments

For more information about environments, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)." To manage environment secrets, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions#secrets)."

Environments, environment secrets, and deployment protection rules are available in public repositories for all current GitHub plans. They are not available on legacy plans, such as Bronze, Silver, or Gold. For access to environments, environment secrets, and deployment branches in private or internal repositories, you must use GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise. If you are on a GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, or GitHub Team plan, other deployment protection rules, such as a wait timer or required reviewers, are only available for public repositories.
