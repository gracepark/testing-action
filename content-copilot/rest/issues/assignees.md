# Issue assignees

Use the REST API to manage assignees on issues and pull requests.

## About issue and pull request assignees

You can use the REST API to view, add, and remove assignees on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "shared" actions for both features, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided within the Issues endpoints.
