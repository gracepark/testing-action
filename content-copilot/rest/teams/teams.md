# Teams

Use the REST API to create and manage teams in your GitHub organization.

## About teams

These endpoints are only available to authenticated members of the team's [organization](/rest/orgs). OAuth access tokens require the `read:org` [scope](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps). GitHub generates the team's `slug` from the team `name`.
