# Deploy keys

Use the REST API to create and manage deploy keys.

## About deploy keys

You can launch projects from a repository on GitHub.com to your server by using a deploy key, which is an SSH key that grants access to a single repository. GitHub attaches the public part of the key directly to your repository instead of a personal account, and the private part of the key remains on your server. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/delivering-deployments)."

Deploy keys can either be set up using the following API endpoints, or by using GitHub. To learn how to set deploy keys up in GitHub, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)."
