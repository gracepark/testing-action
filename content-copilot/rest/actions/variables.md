## About variables in GitHub Actions

You can use the REST API to create, update, delete, and retrieve information about variables that can be used in workflows in GitHub Actions. Variables allow you to store non-sensitive information, such as a username, in your repository, repository environments, or organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)" in the GitHub Actions documentation.
