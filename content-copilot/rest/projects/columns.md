**Notes:**

- These endpoints only interact with projects (classic). To manage Projects, use the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-api-to-manage-projects)."
- To create a new classic project, the organization, user, or repository must already have at least one classic project.
