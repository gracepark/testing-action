## About repository autolinks

To help streamline your workflow, you can use the REST API to add autolinks to external resources like JIRA issues and Zendesk tickets. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."

GitHub Apps require repository administration permissions with read or write access to use these endpoints.
