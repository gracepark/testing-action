Use the REST API to interact with GitHub Apps

## About GitHub Apps

If you are using your app with GitHub Actions and want to modify workflow files, you must authenticate on behalf of the user with an OAuth token that includes the `workflow` scope. The user must have admin or write permission to the repository that contains the workflow file. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes)."

This page lists endpoints that you can access while authenticated as a GitHub App. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app)".

See "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps#installations)" for a list of endpoints that require authentication as a GitHub App installation.
