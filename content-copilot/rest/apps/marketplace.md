# GitHub Marketplace

Use the REST API to interact with GitHub Marketplace

## About GitHub Marketplace

For more information about GitHub Marketplace, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace)."

These endpoints allow you to see which customers are using a pricing plan, see a customer's purchases, and see if an account has an active subscription.

### Testing with stubbed endpoints

You can [test your GitHub App](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/testing-your-app) with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is hard-coded, fake data that will not change based on actual subscriptions.

To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether the API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.

Make sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.
