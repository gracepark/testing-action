# Participating in a discussion

You can converse with the community and maintainers in a forum within the repository for a project on GitHub.

**Who can use this feature**: People with read access to a repository can participate in discussions and polls in the repository. People with read access to the source repository for organization discussions can participate in discussions and polls in that organization. 

## About participation in a discussion

GitHub Discussions is an open forum for conversation among maintainers and the community for a repository or organization on GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)."

In addition to starting or viewing discussions and polls, you can:

- Comment in response to the original comment from the author of the discussion
- Create a comment thread by replying to an individual comment that another community member made within the discussion
- React to comments with emoji
- Upvote discussions and top-level comments to give them more visibility

You can block users and report disruptive content to maintain a safe and pleasant environment for yourself on GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github)."

## Prerequisites

GitHub Discussions must be enabled for the repository or organization for you to participate in a discussion in the repository or organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-an-organization)."

## Marking a comment as an answer

Discussion authors and users with the triage role or greater for a repository can mark a comment as the answer to a discussion in the repository.
Similarly, discussion authors and users with the triage role or greater for the source repository for organization discussions can mark a comment as the answer to a discussion in the organization.

You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions#about-categories-and-formats-for-discussions)."

When you mark a question as an answer, GitHub will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.

![Screenshot of a comment marked as the answer to a discussion.](/assets/images/help/discussions/comment-marked-as-answer.png)

You can't mark a threaded comment in response to a comment as the answer to a discussion. You also can't mark a minimized comment as the answer to a discussion.
