# Collaborating with maintainers using discussions

You can contribute to the goals, plans, health, and community for a project on GitHub by communicating with the maintainers of the project in a discussion.

**Who can use this feature**: People with read access to a repository can start and participate in discussions and polls in the repository. People with read access to the source repository for organization discussions can start and participate in discussions and polls in the organization. 

## About collaboration with maintainers using GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions is an open forum for conversation among maintainers and the community for a repository or organization on GitHub. If you use or contribute to a project, you can start a discussion to make suggestions and engage with maintainers and community members about your plans, questions, ideas, and feedback. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)."

All discussions must be created in a category. For repository discussions, people with maintain or admin permissions to the repository define the categories for discussions in that repository. For organization discussions, people with maintain or admin permissions to the source repository define the categories for discussions in that organization. Each category has a format: open-ended discussion, question and answer, or announcement. Maintainers can use categories with the announcement format to share information, releases, or events. To keep discussions in these categories focused on important updates, only people with maintain or admin permissions can create new discussions, but anyone can comment and reply.

Repository administrators and project maintainers can delete a discussion in that repository. Similarly, administrators and maintainers of the source repository for an organization's discussions can delete a discussion in that organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions#deleting-a-discussion)."

GitHub will automatically recognize community members who contribute the most comments marked as answers to discussions with a question/answer format. These members appear in a list of the most helpful contributors to the project's discussions, if their privacy settings allow. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/setting-your-profile-to-private)."

As your project grows, you can grant higher access permissions to active members of your community. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/guides/granting-higher-permissions-to-top-contributors)."

![Screenshot of the "Discussions" page in a repository. The "Most helpful" section is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/discussions/most-helpful.png)

Community members can upvote discussions and top-level comments inside discussions to communicate with maintainers about ideas that matter to them. Project maintainers can then sort discussions and comments based on upvotes to gain insight into what community members value.

For more information about participation in discussions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/participating-in-a-discussion)."

## Prerequisites

To collaborate with maintainers in repository discussions, a repository administrator or project maintainer must enable GitHub Discussions for the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)."

To collaborate with maintainers in organization discussions, GitHub Discussions must be enabled for the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-an-organization)."

## Converting an issue to a discussion

If an issue turns out to be a question or open-ended conversation instead of a work item to track and prioritize, you can convert the issue to a discussion. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions#converting-an-issue-to-a-discussion)."
