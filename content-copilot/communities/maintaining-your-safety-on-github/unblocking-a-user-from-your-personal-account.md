# Unblocking a user from your personal account

If you've mended fences with a GitHub user you've blocked, you can unblock their account.

When you unblock a user, they'll be able to invite you to be a collaborator to their repositories. If they [@mention you](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) anywhere on GitHub, you'll receive notifications.

In repositories you own, the user will be able to collaborate normally.

You can unblock a user in your account settings or from the user's profile page.

## Unblocking a user in your account settings

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
