# Reporting abuse or spam

You can report behavior and content that violates community guidelines and terms.

**Who can use this feature**: Owners, collaborators, prior contributors, and people with write access can report issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments on issues, pull requests, discussions, and commits. Anyone can report apps in GitHub Marketplace.

## About reporting abuse or spam

GitHub provides a baseline code of conduct for everyone who uses GitHub.com. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines)."

You can report users that have violated GitHub's Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. You can also report issues, pull requests, or comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If reported content is enabled for a public repository, you can also report content directly to repository maintainers.
