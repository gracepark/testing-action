# About wikis

You can host documentation for your repository in a wiki, so that others can use and contribute to your project.

 Wikis are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to  share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)."

With wikis, you can write content just like everywhere else on GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)." We use [our open-source Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup) to convert different formats into HTML, so you can choose to write in Markdown or any other supported format.

If you create a wiki in a public repository, the wiki is available to the public. If you create a wiki in a private repository, only people with access to the repository can access the wiki. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility)."

You can edit wikis directly on GitHub, or you can edit wiki files locally. By default, only people with write access to your repository can make changes to wikis, although you can allow everyone on GitHub.com to contribute to a wiki in a public repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis)."

**Note:** Search engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis)."

If you need search engines to index your content, you can use [GitHub Pages](/pages) in a public repository.
