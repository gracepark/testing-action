# Adding support resources to your project

You can create a SUPPORT file to let people know about ways to get help with your project.

To direct people to specific support resources, you can add a SUPPORT file to your repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's SUPPORT file.

You can create default support resources for your organization or personal account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

**Tip:** To help people find your support guidelines, you can link to your SUPPORT file from other places in your repository, such as your [README file](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

## Adding support resources to your project

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

1. Above the list of files, using the **Add file** drop-down, click **Create new file**.

1. In the file name field, type _SUPPORT.md_ (with all caps).
1. On the **Edit new file** tab, add information about how people can get support for your project.
1. To review your SUPPORT file, click **Preview**.

1. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)."

1. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub.com, click the email address drop-down menu and select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then a no-reply will be the default commit author email address.  For more information about the exact form the no-reply email address can take, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)."

1. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)."
