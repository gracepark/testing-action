# Encouraging helpful contributions to your project with labels

Apply the `good first issue` label to issues in your repository to highlight opportunities for people to contribute to your project.

You can apply the `good first issue` label to issues in your public repository so that people can find them when searching by labels. For more information about searching by labels, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label)."

GitHub uses an algorithm to determine the most approachable issues in each repository and surface them in various places on GitHub.com. Adding the `good first issue` label can increase the likelihood that your issues are surfaced.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-issue-opened" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M8 9.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Z"></path><path d="M8 0a8 8 0 1 1 0 16A8 8 0 0 1 8 0ZM1.5 8a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 13 0 6.5 6.5 0 0 0-13 0Z"></path></svg> **Issues**.
