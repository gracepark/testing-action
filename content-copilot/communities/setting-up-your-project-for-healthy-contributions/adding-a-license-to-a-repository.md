# Adding a license to a repository

You can include an open source license in your repository to make it easier for other people to contribute.

If you include a detectable license in your repository, people who visit your repository will see it at the top of the repository page. To read the entire license file, click the license name.

Open source licenses enable others to freely use, change, and distribute the project in your repository. For more information on repository licenses, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)."

1. Above the list of files, using the **Add file** drop-down, click **Create new file**.

1. In the file name field, type _LICENSE_ or _LICENSE.md_ (with all caps).
1. Under the file name, click **Choose a license template**.

1. On the left side of the page, under "Add a license to your project," review the available licenses, then select a license from the list.
1. Click **Review and submit**.

1. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)."
1. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)."

1. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub.com, click the email address drop-down menu and select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then a no-reply will be the default commit author email address.  For more information about the exact form the no-reply email address can take, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)."
