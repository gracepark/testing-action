# Limiting interactions for your personal account

You can temporarily enforce a period of limited activity for certain users in all public repositories owned by your personal account.

**Who can use this feature**: Anyone can limit interactions for their own personal account.

## About temporary interaction limits

Limiting interactions for your personal account enables temporary interaction limits for all public repositories owned by your personal account. Enabling an interaction limit for a repository restricts certain users from commenting, opening issues, creating pull requests, reacting with emojis, editing existing comments, and editing titles of issues and pull requests.

When you enable an interaction limit, you can choose a duration for the limit: 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, or 6 months. After the duration of your limit passes, users can resume normal activity in your public repositories.

There are three types of interaction limits.
- **Limit to existing users**: Limits activity for users with accounts that are less than 24 hours old who do not have prior contributions and are not collaborators.
- **Limit to prior contributors**: Limits activity for users who have not previously contributed to the default branch of the repository and are not collaborators.
- **Limit to repository collaborators**: Limits activity for users who do not have write access to the repository.

When you enable user-wide activity limitations, you can't enable or disable interaction limits on individual repositories. For more information on limiting activity for an individual repository, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository)."

You can also block users. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account)."
