# Release note content type

Release notes enable readers to understand and prepare for the user-facing changes in each release of GitHub's versioned enterprise products.

Articles in the "Contributing to GitHub Docs" section refer to the documentation itself and are a resource for GitHub staff and open source contributors.

Good release notes provide administrators the necessary information to plan system upgrades in environments that require change control, and support end users who want to understand and prepare to use new GitHub features and functionality.

Writers source, edit, and publish release notes in collaboration with product DRIs, feature owners, and individual engineers at GitHub. For each individual release, we group release notes by predefined types.

We publish the release notes for [GitHub Enterprise Server](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/release-notes)(GHES) and [GitHub AE](/github-ae@latest/admin/release-notes)(GHAE) on GitHub Docs, in the "Enterprise administrators" documentation set.

## Types of releases

GitHub Docs provides release notes for feature releases of GHES and GHAE, and for patch releases of GHES. For more information about releases of each product, see "About upgrades to new releases" in the [GHES](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/overview/about-upgrades-to-new-releases) or [GHAE](/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-upgrades-to-new-releases) documentation.

## Guidance and example release notes

You can find guidance for the format, style, and tone of release notes, as well as examples of each type of note, in "[AUTOTITLE](/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide)".
