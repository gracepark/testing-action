**Warning:** If you're currently responsible for paying for GitHub in your organization, removing yourself from the organization **does not** update the billing information on file for the organization. If you are currently responsible for billing, **you must** have another owner or billing manager for the organization [update the organization's payment method](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/adding-or-editing-a-payment-method).
