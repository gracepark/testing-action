# Blocking command line pushes that expose your personal email address

If you've chosen to keep your email address private when performing web-based operations, you can also choose to block command line pushes that may expose your personal email address.

When you push commits from the command line, the email address that you've [set in Git](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address) is associated with your commits. If you enable this setting, each time you push to GitHub, weâ€™ll check the most recent commit. If the author email on that commit is a private email on your GitHub account, we will block the push and warn you about exposing your private email.

For more information on commit email addresses, including your `noreply` email address for GitHub, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)."
