# Adding an email address to your GitHub account

GitHub allows you to add as many email addresses to your account as you like. If you set an email address in your local Git configuration, you will need to add it to your account settings in order to connect your commits to your account. For more information about your email address and commits, see "[Setting your commit email address](/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address/)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Notes**:
- You cannot verify email addresses from disposable email address services (services that allow you to receive email at a temporary address that expires after a certain time). If you'd like to keep your email address private, you can use a GitHub-provided `noreply` email address. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github)."
- If you're a member of an enterprise with managed users, you cannot make changes to your email address on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#enterprise-managed-users)."
