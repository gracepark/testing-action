# Permission levels for a project board owned by a personal account

A project board owned by a personal account has two permission levels: the project board owner and collaborators.

## Permissions overview

There is only one owner of a user-owned project board; this permission cannot be shared with another personal account. In addition to the owner, other people can collaborate on project boards.

There are three levels of permissions for project board collaborators:

- **Read**, which gives people permission to view a classic project.
- **Write**, which gives people permission to view a classic project, link repositories to a classic project, and interact with a classic project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board)."
- **Admin**, which gives people permission to view a classic project, interact with a classic project, manage classic project settings, and manage other people's access to the classic project.

## Owner and admin permissions for a user-owned project board

The project board owner and collaborators with admin access have full control of the project board. In addition to all the permissions allowed by project board collaborators, a project board owner and collaborator with admin access can:
