# Managing accessibility settings

GitHub's user interface can adapt to your vision, hearing, motor, cognitive, or learning needs.

## About accessibility settings

To create an experience on GitHub.com that fits your needs, you can customize the user interface. Accessibility settings can be essential for people with disabilities, but can be useful to anyone. For example, customization of keyboard shortcuts is essential to people who navigate using voice control, but can be useful to anyone when a keyboard shortcut for GitHub clashes with another application shortcut.

You can decide whether you want to use some or all keyboard shortcuts on GitHub.com and you can also control the display of animated images.

## Managing keyboard shortcuts

You can perform actions across the GitHub website by using your keyboard alone. Keyboard shortcuts can be useful to save time, but can be activated accidentally or interfere with assistive technology.

By default, all keyboard shortcuts are enabled on GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)."

1. Under "Keyboard shortcuts", manage settings for your keyboard shortcuts.

   - To disable shortcut keys that don't use modifiers keys like <kbd>Control</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>, under "General", deselect **Character keys**.
     - If you disable character keys, you may still be able to trigger shortcuts for your web browser, and you can still trigger shortcuts for GitHub that use a modifier key.
