# Deleting your personal account

You can delete your personal account on GitHub.com at any time.

## About deletion of your personal account

Deleting your personal account removes all repositories, forks of private repositories, wikis, issues, pull requests, and pages owned by your account. Issues and pull requests you've created and comments you've made in repositories owned by other users will not be deleted. Your resources and comments will become associated with the [ghost user](https://github.com/ghost).

If the account namespace includes any public repositories that contain an action listed on GitHub Marketplace, or that had more than 100 clones or more than 100 uses of GitHub Actions in the week prior to deletion, GitHub permanently retires the owner name and repository name combination (`OWNER/REPOSITORY-NAME`) when you delete your account.

If the account namespace includes any packages or container images stored in a GitHub Packages registry, GitHub deletes the packages and container images when you delete your account. By deleting your account, you may break projects that depend on these packages and images.

If the account namespace includes any public container images with more than 5,000 downloads, the full name of these container images (`NAMESPACE/IMAGE-NAME`) is permanently retired when you delete the account to ensure the container image name cannot be reused in the future.

When you delete your account we stop billing you. The email address associated with the account becomes available for use with a different account on GitHub.com. After 90 days, the account name also becomes available to anyone else to use on a new account. 

If you're the only owner of an organization, you must transfer ownership to another person or delete the organization before you can delete your personal account. If there are other owners in the organization, you must remove yourself from the organization before you can delete your personal account.

## Back up your account data

Before you delete your personal account, make a copy of all repositories, private forks, wikis, issues, and pull requests owned by your account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/backing-up-a-repository)."
