# Managing your subscriptions

To help you manage your notifications efficiently, there are several ways to unsubscribe.

To help you understand your subscriptions and decide whether to unsubscribe, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** Instead of unsubscribing, you have the option to ignore a repository. If you ignore a repository, you won't receive any notifications. We don't recommend ignoring repositories as you won't be notified if you're @mentioned. If you're experiencing abuse and want to ignore a repository, please visit [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) so we can help. GitHub does not tolerate abuse. For more information on GitHub's policies, see our [Terms of Service](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## Choosing how to unsubscribe

To unwatch (or unsubscribe from) repositories quickly, navigate to [github.com/watching](https://github.com/watching) to see all the repositories you're following. For more information, see "[Unwatching repositories](#unwatching-repositories)."

To unsubscribe from multiple notifications at the same time, you can unsubscribe using your inbox or on the subscriptions page. Both of these options offer more context about your subscriptions than the "Watched repositories" page.

### Benefits of unsubscribing from your inbox

When you unsubscribe from notifications in your inbox, you have several other triaging options and can filter your notifications by custom filters and discussion types. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-and-triaging-notifications/managing-notifications-from-your-inbox)."

### Benefits of unsubscribing from the subscriptions page

When you unsubscribe from notifications on the subscriptions page, you can see more of the notifications you're subscribed to and sort them by "Most recently subscribed" or "Least recently subscribed".

The subscriptions page shows you all of the notifications that you're currently subscribed to, including notifications that you have marked as **Done** in your inbox.

You can only filter your subscriptions by repository and the reason you're receiving the notification.

## Unsubscribing from notifications in your inbox

When you unsubscribe from notifications in your inbox, they will automatically disappear from your inbox.
