# Showing an overview of your activity on your profile

You can enable the activity overview section on your profile to give viewers more context about the types of contributions you make.

## About the activity overview

When you enable the activity overview section on your profile, viewers can see more information about the types of contributions you make and repositories you're most active in. A viewer can only see information in the activity overview about repositories they have read access to. Once enabled, a viewer can also filter your contribution graph and activity timeline for a specific organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile)."
