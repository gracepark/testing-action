# Showing your private contributions and achievements on your profile

Your GitHub profile shows a graph of your repository contributions over the past year. You can choose to show anonymized activity from private and internal repositories in addition to the activity from public repositories.

If you publicize your private contributions, people without access to the private repositories you work in won't be able to see the details of your private contributions. Instead, they'll see the number of private contributions you made on any given day. Your public contributions will include detailed information. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile)."
