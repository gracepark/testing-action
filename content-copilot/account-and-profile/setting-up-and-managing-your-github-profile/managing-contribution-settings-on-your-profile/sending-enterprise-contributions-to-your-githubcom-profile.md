# Sending enterprise contributions to your GitHub.com profile

You can highlight your work on GitHub Enterprise by sending the contribution counts to your GitHub.com profile.

## About enterprise contributions on your GitHub.com profile

Your GitHub.com profile shows GitHub Enterprise contribution counts from the past 90 days. GitHub Enterprise sends updates hourly. Contribution counts from GitHub Enterprise are considered private contributions. The commit details will only show the contribution counts and that these contributions were made in a GitHub Enterprise environment outside of GitHub.com.

You can decide whether to show counts for private contributions on your profile. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-your-private-contributions-and-achievements-on-your-profile)."

For more information about how contributions are calculated, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile)."
