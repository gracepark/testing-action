# Pinning items to your profile

You can pin gists and repositories to your profile so other people can quickly see your best work.

You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository. Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)"

You can pin any public gist you own.

Pinned items include important information about the item, like the number of stars a repository has received or the first few lines of a gist. Once you pin items to your profile, the "Pinned" section replaces the "Popular repositories" section on your profile.

You can reorder the items in the "Pinned" section. In the upper-right corner of a pin, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-grabber" aria-label="The grabber symbol" role="img"><path d="M10 13a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Zm0-4a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Zm-4 4a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Zm5-9a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0ZM7 8a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0ZM6 5a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z"></path></svg>  and drag the pin to a new location.
