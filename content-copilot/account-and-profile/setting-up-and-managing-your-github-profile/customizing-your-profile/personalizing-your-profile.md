# Personalizing your profile

You can share information about yourself with other GitHub users by setting a profile picture and adding a bio to your profile.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:**
  Any details you add to your public GitHub profile will be visible to all GitHub users, including in regions where local laws, regulations, or cultural norms may pose risks to expressing your identity. We respect everyoneâ€™s decision about whether or not to share information about themselves on their GitHub profile.

</div>

## Changing your profile picture

Your profile picture helps identify you across GitHub in pull requests, comments, contributions pages, and graphs.

When you sign up for an account, GitHub provides you with a randomly generated "identicon". [Your identicon](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons) generates from a hash of your user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern. You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note**: Your profile picture should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file, and it must be less than 1 MB in size and smaller than 3000 by 3000 pixels. For the best quality rendering, we recommend keeping the image at about 500 by 500 pixels.

</div>

If you use Gravatar, and your Gravatar image is associated with the email you use for GitHub, the image will be shown as your GitHub profile picture by default (rather than an identicon). To change your GitHub profile picture, you can either upload a new image to Gravatar, or upload a new image to GitHub and override the Gravatar image.

## Changing your profile name

You can change the name that is displayed on your profile. This name may also be displayed next to comments you make on private repositories owned by an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-display-of-member-names-in-your-organization)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** If you're a member of an enterprise with managed users, any changes to your profile name must be made through your identity provider instead of GitHub.com. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#enterprise-managed-users)."

</div>

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

    ![Screenshot of a user's account menu on GitHub. The menu item "Settings" is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.png)

1. Under "Public profile", in the "Name" field, type the name you want to be displayed on your profile.

## Adding a bio to your profile

Add a bio to your profile to share information about yourself with other GitHub users. With the help of [@mentions](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and emoji, you can include information about where you currently or have previously worked, what type of work you do, or even what kind of coffee you drink.

For a longer-form and more prominent way of displaying customized information about yourself, you can also use a profile README. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:**
  If you have the activity overview section enabled for your profile and you @mention an organization you're a member of in your profile bio, then that organization will be featured first in your activity overview. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-an-overview-of-your-activity-on-your-profile)."

</div>

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

    ![Screenshot of a user's account menu on GitHub. The menu item "Settings" is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.png)

1. Under "Public profile", in the "Bio" field, type the content that you want displayed on your profile. The bio field is limited to 160 characters.

   <div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

   **Tip:** When you @mention an organization, only those that you're a member of will autocomplete. You can still @mention organizations that you're not a member of, like a previous employer, but the organization name won't autocomplete for you.

   </div>

1. Click **Update profile**.

## Setting a status

You can set a status to display information about your current availability on GitHub. Your status will show:
- On your GitHub profile page
- When people hover over your username or avatar on GitHub
- On a team page for a team where you're a team member. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#team-pages)."
- On the organization dashboard in an organization where you're a member. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-your-organization-dashboard)."

When you set your status, you can also let people know that you have limited availability on GitHub.

If you select the "Busy" option, when people @mention your username, assign you an issue or pull request, or request a pull request review from you, a note next to your username will show that you're busy. You will also be excluded from automatic review assignment for pull requests assigned to any teams you belong to. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team)."

## Earning Achievements

Achievements celebrate specific events and actions that happen on GitHub. They will appear as small badges listed in the sidebar of your profile. Clicking or hovering on an achievement will show a detailed view that hints at how the achievement was earned, with a short description and links to the contributing events. The event links will only be visible to users that have access to the repository or organization that the event took place in. Event links will appear inaccessible to all users without access.

To stop private contributions from counting toward your Achievements, or to turn off Achievements entirely, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-your-private-contributions-and-achievements-on-your-profile)."
