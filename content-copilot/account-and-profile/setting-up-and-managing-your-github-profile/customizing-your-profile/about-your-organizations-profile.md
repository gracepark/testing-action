# About your organization's profile

Your organization's profile page shows basic information about your organization.

You can optionally choose to add a description, location, website, and email address for your organization, and pin important repositories. You can customize your organization's public profile by adding a README.md file. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)."

Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can confirm their organization's identity and display a "Verified" badge on their organization's profile page by verifying the organization's domains with GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-organization)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
