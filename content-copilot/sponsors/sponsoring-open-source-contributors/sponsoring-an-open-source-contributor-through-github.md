# Sponsoring an open source contributor through GitHub

You can make payments through GitHub to a developer or organization who designs, creates, or maintains open source projects you depend on.

**Who can use this feature**: Anyone can sponsor accounts on behalf of their own personal account. Organization owners and billing managers can sponsor accounts on behalf of their organization.

## About sponsorships with payments through GitHub

You can sponsor anyone with a sponsored developer profile or sponsored organization profile on behalf of your personal account or an organization. You can choose from multiple sponsorship tiers, with one-time or monthly payment amounts and benefits that are set by the sponsored account. Your sponsorship will share your accountâ€™s existing billing date, payment method, and receipt.
