# Sponsoring an open source contributor through Patreon

You can make payments through Patreon on GitHub.com to a developer or organization who designs, creates, or maintains open source projects you depend on.

**Who can use this feature**: Anyone can sponsor accounts on behalf of their own personal account. Organization owners and billing managers can sponsor accounts on behalf of their organization.

## About sponsoring through Patreon

Rather than paying through GitHub, you can choose to sponsor eligible maintainers through Patreon on GitHub.com.

To sponsor through Patreon on GitHub.com, both you and the selected maintainer must link your Patreon accounts to your GitHub accounts. You can then choose to sponsor maintainers through Patreon on GitHub.com, or you can sponsor the maintainer directly through the Patreon website while receiving recognition on GitHub. For more information on sponsoring through the Patreon website, see [Become a patron of a creator](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913709-Become-a-patron-of-a-creator) in the Patreon documentation.

Currently, if you sponsor a maintainer through Patreon on GitHub.com, you can only choose their lowest Patreon tier. However, if you sponsor a maintainer for a higher tier through the Patreon site, you will receive recognition for that sponsorship on GitHub.
