# Paying for GitHub Sponsors by invoice

Organizations can set up invoicing to sponsor accounts.

## About paying for GitHub Sponsors by invoice

Organizations can use an invoice method to participate in the GitHub Sponsors program.

When an organization pays by invoice, they will not be charged the 3% credit card processing fee that applies to sponsorships from organization accounts. The 3% GitHub service processing fee still applies to invoiced billing. For more information about sponsorship fees, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor#sponsorship-fees)."

Organizations paying by invoice are invoiced separately for their GitHub Sponsors payments and their other payments to GitHub. Organizations can be invoiced for sponsorships and pay via credit card for other payments to GitHub.

### Requirements

- The organization needs to sign the sponsorship agreement which is a 3 year commitment. The GitHub Invoiced Sponsor Agreement is separate from other services.
- The organization needs a minimum spend of 5,000 US dollars (USD) per year on sponsoring.
- The organization needs to pay the invoice within 30 days.

Once the organization reaches the yearly minimum spend, they can opt out of being invoiced for the rest of the year.

## Switching to paying by invoice

If your organization currently pays for GitHub Sponsors by credit card, you can switch to paying by invoice. Switching to paying by invoice will not affect the billing schedule for other GitHub products like GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages.

**Note:** Changing your payment method to invoiced billing will cancel your current sponsorships and your current sponsored projects will receive a cancellation email. You will need to set up your sponsorships again after switching to paying by invoice. You can view your recently canceled sponsorships in your past sponsorships list. Additionally, GitHub will email you a list of your active sponsorships prior to switching to invoiced billing. You can re-sponsor projects by importing that list into the bulk sponsorship tool. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor#sponsoring-accounts-in-bulk)."

## Understanding your GitHub Sponsors invoice

Payments to GitHub Sponsors are invoiced through Stripe. Organizations will receive an invoice by email from Stripe, Inc. This invoice is separate from the one you receive for GitHub services, and may have a different payment date.
