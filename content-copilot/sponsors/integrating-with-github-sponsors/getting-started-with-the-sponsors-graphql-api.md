# Getting started with the Sponsors GraphQL API

Using the GraphQL API, you can build custom integrations to manage or review your sponsorships.

To get started with the GraphQL API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql)."

You can find the details about the Sponsors GraphQL API in the reference docs. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/reference)." We recommend using the GraphQL explorer to build your GraphQL calls. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/using-the-explorer)."
