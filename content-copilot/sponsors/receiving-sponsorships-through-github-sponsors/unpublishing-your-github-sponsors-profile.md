# Unpublishing your GitHub Sponsors profile

If you don't have any sponsors, you can unpublish your GitHub Sponsors profile.

If you have sponsors, you'll need to contact GitHub Support to help you unpublish your GitHub Sponsors account.

After your GitHub Sponsors account is unpublished:
- You'll no longer receive sponsorship payments.
- You can request to re-publish your profile.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Your sponsors**.
