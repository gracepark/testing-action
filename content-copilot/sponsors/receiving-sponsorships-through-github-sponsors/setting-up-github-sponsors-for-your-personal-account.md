# Setting up GitHub Sponsors for your personal account

You can become a sponsored developer by joining GitHub Sponsors, completing your sponsored developer profile, creating sponsorship tiers, submitting your bank and tax information, and enabling two-factor authentication for your account on GitHub.com.

## Joining GitHub Sponsors

Anyone who contributes to an open source project and lives in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored developer. Contributions include but are not limited to bug reports, issue triage, code, documentation, leadership, business development, project management, mentorship, and design. If you live in a region that isn't already supported by GitHub Sponsors, you can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the beta of GitHub Sponsors. For a list of supported regions, see [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).

To join GitHub Sponsors as an organization, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."

1. Navigate to [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors).
1. If you are an organization owner, you have more than one eligible account. Click **Get sponsored**, then in the list of accounts, find your personal account.
1. Click **Join the waitlist**.
1. Follow the prompts to complete your contact information.
1. Decide whether to receive sponsorship payouts via a bank account or through a fiscal host. For more information about setting up and using fiscal hosts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/using-a-fiscal-host-to-receive-github-sponsors-payouts)."

    Note that you can only set up your fiscal host information at the time you sign up for GitHub Sponsors. If you decide you want to switch to using a fiscal host after your profile has been set up, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/).
1. Review the [GitHub Sponsors Additional Terms](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-sponsors-additional-terms) and [GitHub Privacy Statement](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), then click **Join the waitlist**.

If you have a bank account in a supported region, GitHub will review your application within two weeks.

1. Click **Update profile**.

## Creating sponsorship tiers

You can publish up to 10 one-time sponsorship tiers and 10 monthly tiers for sponsors to choose from. Each tier has its own one-time or monthly payment amount in US dollars. Publishing tiers is optional.

You can customize the rewards for each tier. For example, rewards for a tier could include:
- Early access to new versions
- Logo or name in README
- Weekly newsletter updates
- Other rewards your sponsors would enjoy âœ¨

You can give all sponsors in a tier access to a private repository by adding the repository to the tier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/managing-your-sponsorship-tiers#adding-a-repository-to-a-sponsorship-tier)."

You can include a welcome message with information about accessing or receiving rewards, which will be visible after payment and in the welcome email.

Once you have published a tier, you cannot edit the price of that tier. Instead, you must retire the tier and create a new tier. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.

The maximum price is US$12,000 per month.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Your sponsors**.

## Submitting your bank information

Note that you can only set up your fiscal host information at the time you sign up for GitHub Sponsors. If you originally chose to use a Stripe Connect account when you signed up for your profile, but would like to switch to using a fiscal host, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). For more information about setting up and using fiscal hosts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/using-a-fiscal-host-to-receive-github-sponsors-payouts)."

If you choose to receive payouts to a bank account, your region of residence and the region of your bank account must match. For a list of supported regions, see [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).
