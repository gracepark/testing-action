# Setting up GitHub Sponsors for your organization

Your organization can join GitHub Sponsors to receive payments for your work.

**Who can use this feature**: Organization owners can set up GitHub Sponsors for an organization.

## Joining GitHub Sponsors

Any organization that contributes to an open source project and legally operates in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored organization. If your organization operates in a region that isn't already supported by GitHub Sponsors, join the waitlist at [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors). For a list of supported regions, see [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).

After you receive an invitation for your organization to join GitHub Sponsors, you can complete the steps below to become a sponsored organization.

To join GitHub Sponsors as an individual contributor outside an organization, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)."

## Creating sponsorship tiers

You can publish up to 10 one-time sponsorship tiers and 10 monthly tiers for sponsors to choose from. Each tier has its own one-time or monthly payment amount in US dollars. Publishing tiers is optional.

You can customize the rewards for each tier. For example, rewards for a tier could include:
- Early access to new versions
- Logo or name in README
- Weekly newsletter updates
- Other rewards your sponsors would enjoy âœ¨

You can give all sponsors in a tier access to a private repository by adding the repository to the tier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/managing-your-sponsorship-tiers#adding-a-repository-to-a-sponsorship-tier)."

You can include a welcome message with information about accessing or receiving rewards, which will be visible after payment and in the welcome email.

Once you have published a tier, you cannot edit the price of that tier. Instead, you must retire the tier and create a new tier. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.

The maximum price is US$12,000 per month.

## Submitting your bank information

As a sponsored organization, you will receive payouts to a bank account in a supported region or via a fiscal host.

Note that you can only set up your fiscal host information at the time you sign up for GitHub Sponsors. If you originally chose to use a Stripe Connect account when you signed up for your profile, but would like to switch to using a fiscal host, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). For more information about setting up and using fiscal hosts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/using-a-fiscal-host-to-receive-github-sponsors-payouts)."

If you choose to receive payouts to a bank account, your bank account can be a dedicated bank account for your organization or a personal bank account. You can get a business bank account through services like [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas). The person setting up GitHub Sponsors for the organization must live in the same supported region, too. For a list of supported regions, see [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).

When applying for a Stripe Connect account, ensure all of your information is correct before you submit your application. It's difficult to update identity information, like your name and date of birth, after your application has been submitted.
