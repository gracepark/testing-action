# Managing your sponsorship tiers

You can add a new sponsorship tier, or edit or retire an existing tier.

## About sponsorship tiers

You can publish up to 10 one-time sponsorship tiers and 10 monthly tiers for sponsors to choose from. Each tier has its own one-time or monthly payment amount in US dollars. Publishing tiers is optional.

You can customize the rewards for each tier. For example, rewards for a tier could include:
- Early access to new versions
- Logo or name in README
- Weekly newsletter updates
- Other rewards your sponsors would enjoy âœ¨

You can give all sponsors in a tier access to a private repository by adding the repository to the tier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/managing-your-sponsorship-tiers#adding-a-repository-to-a-sponsorship-tier)."

You can include a welcome message with information about accessing or receiving rewards, which will be visible after payment and in the welcome email.

Once you have published a tier, you cannot edit the price of that tier. Instead, you must retire the tier and create a new tier. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.

The maximum price is US$12,000 per month.

## Adding a repository to a sponsorship tier

You can give all sponsors in a tier access to a private repository by adding the repository to the tier.

### About adding repositories to a sponsorship tier

To add a repository to a tier, the repository must be private and owned by an organization, and you must have admin access to the repository.

When you add a repository to a tier, GitHub will automatically send repository invitations to new sponsors and remove access when a sponsorship is canceled.

Only personal accounts, not organizations, can be invited to private repositories associated with a sponsorship tier.

You can also manually add or remove collaborators to the repository, and GitHub will not override these in the sync.

### About transfers for repositories that are added to sponsorship tiers

If you transfer a repository that has been added to a sponsorship tier, sponsors who have access to the repository through the tier may be affected.

- If the sponsored profile is for an organization and the repository is transferred to a different organization, current sponsors will be transferred, but new sponsors will not be added. The new owner of the repository can remove existing sponsors.
- If the sponsored profile is for a personal account, the repository is transferred to an organization, and the personal account has admin access to the new repository, existing sponsors will be transferred, and new sponsors will continue to be added to the repository.
- If the repository is transferred to a personal account, all sponsors will be removed and new sponsors will not be added to the repository.
