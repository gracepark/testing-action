# Disabling your GitHub Sponsors account

If you no longer want to participate in GitHub Sponsors, you can disable your GitHub Sponsors account.

If you are receiving sponsorship payments, you'll need to contact GitHub Support to disable your GitHub Sponsors account.

If you don't have any sponsors, then you can disable your GitHub Sponsors account on GitHub.

If you decide to create a GitHub Sponsors account again, you'll need to reapply.

Alternatively, you can unpublish your sponsors profile and then republish the account without reapplying again. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/unpublishing-your-github-sponsors-profile)."
