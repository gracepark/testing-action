# About GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors allows the developer community to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub.

## About GitHub Sponsors

You can sponsor anyone with a sponsored developer profile or sponsored organization profile on behalf of your personal account or an organization. You can choose from multiple sponsorship tiers, with one-time or monthly payment amounts and benefits that are set by the sponsored account. Your sponsorship will share your account’s existing billing date, payment method, and receipt.

GitHub Sponsors does not charge any fees for sponsorships from personal accounts, so 100% of these sponsorships go to the sponsored developer or organization. GitHub Sponsors charges a fee of up to 6% for sponsorships from organization accounts. The 6% fee is split between the following:

- 3% credit card processing fee
- 3% GitHub service processing fee

Organizations can save the 3% credit card processing fee by switching to invoiced billing for sponsorships. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/paying-for-github-sponsors-by-invoice)."

Anyone who contributes to an open source project and lives in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored developer. Contributions include but are not limited to bug reports, issue triage, code, documentation, leadership, business development, project management, mentorship, and design. If you live in a region that isn't already supported by GitHub Sponsors, you can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the beta of GitHub Sponsors. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors-for-open-source-contributors)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)."

Any organization that contributes to an open source project and legally operates in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored organization. If your organization operates in a region that isn't already supported by GitHub Sponsors, join the waitlist at [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."

When you become a sponsored developer or sponsored organization, additional terms for GitHub Sponsors apply. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-sponsors-additional-terms)."
