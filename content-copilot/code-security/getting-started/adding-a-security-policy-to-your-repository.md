# Adding a security policy to your repository

You can give instructions for how to report a security vulnerability in your project by adding a security policy to your repository.

## About security policies

To give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project, you can add a `SECURITY.md` file to your repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.

You can create a default security policy for your organization or personal account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tip:** To help people find your security policy, you can link to your `SECURITY.md` file from other places in your repository, such as your `README` file. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)."

</div>

After someone reports a security vulnerability in your project, you can use GitHub Security Advisories to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability. For more information about the process of reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities in GitHub, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities#about-reporting-and-disclosing-vulnerabilities-in-projects-on-github)." For more information about repository security advisories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)."

You can also join [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) to browse security-related topics and contribute to security tools and projects.

For an example of a real `SECURITY.md` file, see [https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/SECURITY.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

1. Click **Start setup**.
1. In the new `SECURITY.md` file, add information about supported versions of your project and how to report a vulnerability.

1. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)."

1. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub.com, click the email address drop-down menu and select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then a no-reply will be the default commit author email address.  For more information about the exact form the no-reply email address can take, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)."

    ![Screenshot of a GitHub pull request showing a dropdown menu with options to choose the commit author email address. octocat@github.com is selected.](/assets/images/help/repository/choose-commit-email-address.png)
1. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)."

   ![Screenshot of a GitHub pull request showing a radio button to commit directly to the main branch or to create a new branch. New branch is selected.](/assets/images/help/repository/choose-commit-branch.png)
1. Click **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.
