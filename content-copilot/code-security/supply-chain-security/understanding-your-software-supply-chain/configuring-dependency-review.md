# Configuring dependency review

You can use dependency review to catch vulnerabilities before they are added to your project.

## About dependency review

Dependency review helps you understand dependency changes and the security impact of these changes at every pull request. It provides an easily understandable visualization of dependency changes with a rich diff on the "Files Changed" tab of a pull request. Dependency review informs you of:
- Which dependencies were added, removed, or updated, along with the release dates.
- How many projects use these components.
- Vulnerability data for these dependencies.
