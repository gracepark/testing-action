# Preparing your code for CodeQL analysis

You can build a CodeQL database containing the data needed to analyze your code.

GitHub CodeQL is licensed on a per-user basis upon installation. You can use CodeQL only for certain tasks under the license restrictions. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/about-the-codeql-cli#about-the-github-codeql-license)."

If you have a GitHub Advanced Security license, you can use CodeQL for automated analysis, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)."

## About preparing your code for analysis

Before you analyze your code using CodeQL, you need to create a CodeQL database containing all the data required to run queries on your code. You can create CodeQL databases yourself using the CodeQL CLI.

CodeQL analysis relies on extracting relational data from your code, and using it to build a [CodeQL database](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-glossary/#codeql-database). CodeQL databases contain all of the important information about a codebase, which can be analyzed by executing CodeQL queries against it.

Before you generate a CodeQL database, you need to:

1. Install and set up the CodeQL CLI. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/setting-up-the-codeql-cli)."
1. Check out the code that you want to analyze:
   - For a branch, check out the head of the branch that you want to analyze.
   - For a pull request, check out either the head commit of the pull request, or check out a GitHub-generated merge commit of the pull request.
1. Set up the environment for the codebase, making sure that any dependencies are available. For more information, see "[Creating databases for non-compiled languages](#creating-databases-for-non-compiled-languages)" and "[Creating databases for compiled languages](#creating-databases-for-compiled-languages)."
1. Find the build command, if any, for the codebase. Typically this is available in a configuration file in the CI system.

Once the codebase is ready, you can run `codeql database create` to create the database.

## Running `codeql database create`

CodeQL databases are created by running the following command from the checkout root of your project:

```shell
codeql database create <database> --language=<language-identifier>
```

You must specify:

- `<database>`: a path to the new database to be created. This directory will be created when you execute the commandâ€”you cannot specify an existing directory.
- `--language`: the identifier for the language to create a database for. When used with `--db-cluster`, the option accepts a comma-separated list, or can be specified more than once. CodeQL supports creating databases for the following languages:

| Language | Identifier
|------------------|-------------------
| C/C++ | `cpp`
| C# | `csharp`
| Go | `go`
| Java | `java`
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `javascript`
| Python | `python`
| Ruby | `ruby`

If your codebase has a build command or script that invokes the build process, we recommend that you specify it as well:

```shell
   codeql database create <database> --command <build> \
         --language=<language-identifier>
   ```

You can specify additional options depending on the location of your source file, if the code needs to be compiled, and if you want to create CodeQL databases for more than one language.

You can specify extractor options to customize the behavior of extractors that create CodeQL databases. For more information, see
"[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/extractor-options)."

For full details of all the options you can use when creating databases, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/database-create)."

### Single language example

This example creates a single CodeQL database for the repository checked out at `/checkouts/example-repo`. It uses the JavaScript extractor to create a hierarchical representation of the JavaScript and TypeScript code in the repository. The resulting database is stored in `/codeql-dbs/example-repo`.

```shell
$ codeql database create /codeql-dbs/example-repo --language=javascript \
    --source-root /checkouts/example-repo

> Initializing database at /codeql-dbs/example-repo.
> Running command [/codeql-home/codeql/javascript/tools/autobuild.cmd]
    in /checkouts/example-repo.
> [build-stdout] Single-threaded extraction.
> [build-stdout] Extracting
...
> Finalizing database at /codeql-dbs/example-repo.
> Successfully created database at /codeql-dbs/example-repo.
```

### Multiple language example

This example creates two CodeQL databases for the repository checked out at `/checkouts/example-repo-multi`. It uses:

- `--db-cluster` to request analysis of more than one language.
- `--language` to specify which languages to create databases for.
- `--command` to tell the tool the build command for the codebase, here `make`.
- `--no-run-unnecessary-builds` to tell the tool to skip the build command for languages where it is not needed (like Python).

The resulting databases are stored in `python` and `cpp` subdirectories of `/codeql-dbs/example-repo-multi`.

```shell
$ codeql database create /codeql-dbs/example-repo-multi \
    --db-cluster --language python,cpp \
    --command make --no-run-unnecessary-builds \
    --source-root /checkouts/example-repo-multi

```

## Progress and results

Errors are reported if there are any problems with the options you have specified. For interpreted languages, the extraction progress is displayed in the console. For each source file, the console shows if extraction was successful or if it failed. For compiled languages, the console will display the output of the build system.

When the database is successfully created, youâ€™ll find a new directory at the path specified in the command. If you used the `--db-cluster` option to create more than one database, a subdirectory is created for each language. Each CodeQL database directory contains a number of subdirectories, including the relational data (required for analysis) and a source archiveâ€”a copy of the source files made at the time the database was createdâ€”which is used for displaying analysis results.

## Creating databases for non-compiled languages

The CodeQL CLI includes extractors to create databases for non-compiled languagesâ€”specifically, JavaScript (and TypeScript), Python, and Ruby. These extractors are automatically invoked when you specify JavaScript, Python, or Ruby as the `--language` option when executing `database create`. When creating databases for these languages you must ensure that all additional dependencies are available.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** When you run `database create` for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby, you should not specify a `--command` option. Otherwise this overrides the normal extractor invocation, which will create an empty database. If you create databases for multiple languages and one of them is a compiled language, use the `--no-run-unnecessary-builds` option to skip the command for the languages that donâ€™t need to be compiled.

</div>

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Creating databases for JavaScript requires no additional dependencies, but if the project includes TypeScript files, you must install Node.js 6.x or later. In the command line you can specify `--language=javascript` to extract both JavaScript and TypeScript files:

```shell
codeql database create --language=javascript --source-root <folder-to-extract> <output-folder>/javascript-database
```

Here, we have specified a `--source-root` path, which is the location where database creation is executed, but is not necessarily the checkout root of the codebase.

By default, files in `node_modules` and `bower_components` directories are not extracted.

### Python

When creating databases for Python you must ensure:

- You have Python 3 installed and available to the CodeQL extractor.
- You have the version of Python used by your code installed.
- You have access to the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) packaging management system and can install any packages that the codebase depends on.
- You have installed the [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) pip module.

In the command line you must specify `--language=python`. For example:

```shell
codeql database create --language=python <output-folder>/python-database
```

This executes the `database create` subcommand from the codeâ€™s checkout root, generating a new Python database at `<output-folder>/python-database`.

### Ruby

Creating databases for Ruby requires no additional dependencies. In the command line you must specify `--language=ruby`. For example:

```shell
codeql database create --language=ruby --source-root <folder-to-extract> <output-folder>/ruby-database
```

Here, we have specified a `--source-root` path, which is the location where database creation is executed, but is not necessarily the checkout root of the codebase.

## Creating databases for compiled languages

For compiled languages, CodeQL needs to invoke the required build system to generate a database, therefore the build method must be available to the CLI.

### Detecting the build system

The CodeQL CLI includes autobuilders for C/C++, C#,   and Java code. CodeQL autobuilders allow you to build projects for compiled languages without specifying any build commands. When an autobuilder is invoked, CodeQL examines the source for evidence of a build system and attempts to run the optimal set of commands required to extract a database. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#about-autobuild-for-codeql)."

An autobuilder is invoked automatically when you execute `codeql database create` for a compiled `--language` if you donâ€™t include a
`--command` option. For example, for a Java codebase, you would simply run:

```shell
codeql database create --language=java <output-folder>/java-database
```

If a codebase uses a standard build system, relying on an autobuilder is often the simplest way to create a database. For sources that require non-standard build steps, you may need to explicitly define each step in the command line.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Notes:**

- If you are building a Go database, install the Go toolchain (version 1.11 or later) and, if there are dependencies, the appropriate dependency manager (such as [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/)).
- The Go autobuilder attempts to automatically detect code written in Go in a repository, and only runs build scripts in an attempt to fetch dependencies. To force CodeQL to limit extraction to the files compiled by your build script, set the environment variable `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_GO_BUILD_TRACING=on` or use the `--command` option to specify a build command.

</div>

### Specifying build commands

The following examples are designed to give you an idea of some of the build commands that you can specify for compiled languages.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** The `--command` option accepts a single argumentâ€”if you need to use more than one command, specify `--command` multiple times. If you need to pass subcommands and options, the whole argument needs to be quoted to be interpreted correctly.

</div>

- C/C++ project built using `make`:

  ```shell
  codeql database create cpp-database --language=cpp --command=make
  ```

- C# project built using `dotnet build`:

  It is a good idea to add `/t:rebuild` to ensure that all code will be built, or do a prior `dotnet clean` (code that is not built will not be included in the CodeQL database):

  ```shell
  codeql database create csharp-database --language=csharp --command='dotnet build /t:rebuild'
  ```

- Go project built using the `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_GO_BUILD_TRACING=on` environment variable:

  ```shell
  CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_GO_BUILD_TRACING=on codeql database create go-database --language=go
  ```

- Go project built using a custom build script:

  ```shell
  codeql database create go-database --language=go --command='./scripts/build.sh'
  ```

- Java project built using Gradle:

  ```shell
  # Use `--no-daemon` because a build delegated to an existing daemon cannot be detected by CodeQL:
  codeql database create java-database --language=java --command='gradle --no-daemon clean test'
  ```

- Java project built using Maven:

  ```shell
  codeql database create java-database --language=java --command='mvn clean install'
  ```

- Java project built using Ant:

  ```shell
  codeql database create java-database --language=java --command='ant -f build.xml'
  ```

- Project built using Bazel:

  ```shell
  # Navigate to the Bazel workspace.

  # Before building, remove cached objects
  # and stop all running Bazel server processes.
  bazel clean --expunge

  # Build using the following Bazel flags, to help CodeQL detect the build:
  # `--spawn_strategy=local`: build locally, instead of using a distributed build
  # `--nouse_action_cache`: turn off build caching, which might prevent recompilation of source code
  # `--noremote_accept_cached`, `--noremote_upload_local_results`: avoid using a remote cache
  codeql database create new-database --language=<language> \
  --command='bazel build --spawn_strategy=local --nouse_action_cache --noremote_accept_cached --noremote_upload_local_results //path/to/package:target'

  # After building, stop all running Bazel server processes.
  # This ensures future build commands start in a clean Bazel server process
  # without CodeQL attached.
  bazel shutdown
  ```

- Project built using a custom build script:

  ```shell
  codeql database create new-database --language=<language> --command='./scripts/build.sh'
  ```

This command runs a custom script that contains all of the commands required to build the project.

<a name="using-indirect-build-tracing"></a>

### Using indirect build tracing

If the CodeQL CLI autobuilders for compiled languages do not work with your CI workflow and you cannot wrap invocations of build commands with `codeql database trace-command`, you can use indirect build tracing to create a CodeQL database. To use indirect build tracing, your CI system must be able to set custom environment variables for each build action.

To create a CodeQL database with indirect build tracing, run the following command from the checkout root of your project:

```shell
codeql database init ... --begin-tracing <database>
```

You must specify:

- `<database>`: a path to the new database to be created. This directory will be created when you execute the commandâ€”you cannot specify an existing directory.
- `--begin-tracing`: creates scripts that can be used to set up an environment in which build commands will be traced.

You may specify other options for the `codeql database init` command as normal.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** If the build runs on Windows, you must set either `--trace-process-level <number>` or `--trace-process-name <parent process name>` so that the option points to a parent CI process that will observe all build steps for the code being analyzed.

</div>

The `codeql database init` command will output a message:

```shell
Created skeleton <database>. This in-progress database is ready to be populated by an extractor. In order to initialise tracing, some environment variables need to be set in the shell your build will run in. A number of scripts to do this have been created in <database>/temp/tracingEnvironment. Please run one of these scripts before invoking your build command.

Based on your operating system, we recommend you run: ...
```

The `codeql database init` command creates `<database>/temp/tracingEnvironment` with files that contain environment variables and values that will enable CodeQL to trace a sequence of build steps. These files are named `start-tracing.{json,sh,bat,ps1}`. Use one of these files with your CI systemâ€™s mechanism for setting environment variables for future steps. You can:

- Read the JSON file, process it, and print out environment variables in the format expected by your CI system. For example, Azure DevOps expects `echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=NAME]VALUE"`.
- Or, if your CI system persists the environment,  source the appropriate `start-tracing` script to set the CodeQL variables in the shell environment of the CI system.

Build your code; optionally, unset the environment variables using an `end-tracing.{json,sh,bat,ps1}` script from the directory where the `start-tracing` scripts are stored; and then run the command `codeql database finalize <database>`.

Once you have created a CodeQL database using indirect build tracing, you can work with it like any other CodeQL database. For example, analyze the database, and upload the results to GitHub if you use code scanning.

### Example of creating a CodeQL database using indirect build tracing

The following example shows how you could use indirect build tracing in an Azure DevOps pipeline to create a CodeQL database:

```yaml
steps:
    # Download the CodeQL CLI and query packs...
    # Check out the repository ...

    # Run any pre-build tasks, for example, restore NuGet dependencies...

    # Initialize the CodeQL database.
    # In this example, the CodeQL CLI has been downloaded and placed on the PATH.
    - task: CmdLine@1
       displayName: Initialize CodeQL database
      inputs:
          # Assumes the source code is checked out to the current working directory.
          # Creates a database at `<current working directory>/db`.
          # Running on Windows, so specifies a trace process level.
          script: "codeql database init --language csharp --trace-process-name Agent.Worker.exe --source-root . --begin-tracing db"

    # Read the generated environment variables and values,
    # and set them so they are available for subsequent commands
    # in the build pipeline. This is done in PowerShell in this example.
    - task: PowerShell@1
       displayName: Set CodeQL environment variables
       inputs:
          targetType: inline
          script: >
             $json = Get-Content $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/db/temp/tracingEnvironment/start-tracing.json | ConvertFrom-Json
             $json.PSObject.Properties | ForEach-Object {
                 $template = "##vso[task.setvariable variable="
                 $template += $_.Name
                 $template += "]"
                 $template += $_.Value
                 echo "$template"
             }

    # Execute the pre-defined build step. Note the `msbuildArgs` variable.
    - task: VSBuild@1
        inputs:
          solution: '**/*.sln'
          msbuildArgs: /p:OutDir=$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
          platform: Any CPU
          configuration: Release
