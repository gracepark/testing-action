# Error: "Out of disk" or Error: "Out of memory"

If you see one of these errors with GitHub Actions, you can try alternative runners.

## Use self-hosted runners

Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners can provide. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)." If you're using CodeQL with advanced setup, you can review the recommended hardware resources for running CodeQL to make sure your self-hosted runners meet those requirements. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/recommended-hardware-resources-for-running-codeql)."
