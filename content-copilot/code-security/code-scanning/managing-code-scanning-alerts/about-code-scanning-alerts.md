# About code scanning alerts

Learn about the different types of code scanning alerts and the information that helps you understand the problem each alert highlights.

Code scanning is available for all public repositories on GitHub.com. Code scanning is also available for private repositories owned by organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and have a license for GitHub Advanced Security. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)."

## About alerts from code scanning

You can configure code scanning to check the code in a repository using the default CodeQL analysis, a third-party analysis, or multiple types of analysis. When the analysis is complete, the resulting alerts are displayed alongside each other in the security view of the repository. Results from third-party tools or from custom queries may not include all of the properties that you see for alerts detected by GitHub's default CodeQL analysis. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning)."

By default, code scanning analyzes your code periodically on the default branch and during pull requests. For information about managing alerts on a pull request, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."

You can audit the actions taken in response to code scanning alerts using GitHub tools. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/auditing-security-alerts)."

## About alert details

Each alert highlights a problem with the code and the name of the tool that identified it. You can see the line of code that triggered the alert, as well as properties of the alert, such as the alert severity, security severity, and the nature of the problem. Alerts also tell you when the issue was first introduced. For alerts identified by CodeQL analysis, you will also see information on how to fix the problem.

The status and details on the alert page only reflect the state of the alert on the default branch of the repository, even if the alert exists in other branches. You can see the status of the alert on non-default branches in the **Affected branches** section on the right-hand side of the alert page. If an alert doesn't exist in the default branch, the status of the alert will display as "in pull request" or "in branch" and will be colored grey.

If you configure code scanning using CodeQL, you can also find data-flow problems in your code. Data-flow analysis finds potential security issues in code, such as: using data insecurely, passing dangerous arguments to functions, and leaking sensitive information.

When code scanning reports data-flow alerts, GitHub shows you how data moves through the code. Code scanning allows you to identify the areas of your code that leak sensitive information, and that could be the entry point for attacks by malicious users.

### About severity levels

Alert severity levels may be `Error`, `Warning`, or `Note`.

If code scanning is enabled as a pull request check, the check will fail if it detects any results with a severity of `error`. You can specify which severity level of code scanning alerts causes a check failure. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure)."

### About security severity levels

Code scanning displays security severity levels for alerts that are generated by security queries. Security severity levels can be `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.

To calculate the security severity of an alert, we use Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) data. CVSS is an open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities, and is commonly used by other security products to score alerts. For more information about how severity levels are calculated, see [this blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-19-codeql-code-scanning-new-severity-levels-for-security-alerts/).

By default, any code scanning results with a security severity of `Critical` or `High` will cause a check failure. You can specify which security severity level for code scanning results should cause a check failure. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure)."

### About analysis origins

You can run multiple configurations of code analysis on a repository, using different tools and targeting different languages or areas of the code. Each configuration of code scanning is the analysis origin for all the alerts it generates. For example, an alert generated using the default CodeQL analysis with GitHub Actions will have a different analysis origin from an alert generated externally and uploaded via the code scanning API.

If you use multiple configurations to analyze a file, any problems detected by the same query are reported as alerts with multiple analysis origins. If an alert has more than one analysis origin, a <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-workflow" aria-label="The workflow icon" role="img"><path d="M0 1.75C0 .784.784 0 1.75 0h3.5C6.216 0 7 .784 7 1.75v3.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 5.25 7H4v4a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h4v-1.25C9 9.784 9.784 9 10.75 9h3.5c.966 0 1.75.784 1.75 1.75v3.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.25 16h-3.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 9 14.25v-.75H5A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 2.5 11V7h-.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 5.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v3.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h3.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-3.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25Zm9 9a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v3.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h3.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-3.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25Z"></path></svg> icon will appear next to any relevant branch in the **Affected branches** section on the right-hand side of the alert page.

**Note:** Sometimes a code scanning alert displays as fixed for one analysis origin but is still open for a second analysis origin. You can resolve this by re-running the second code scanning configuration to update the alert status for that analysis origin.

### About labels for alerts that are not found in application code

GitHub assigns a category label to alerts that are not found in application code. The label relates to the location of the alert.

- Generated: Code generated by the build process
- Test: Test code
- Library: Library or third-party code
- Documentation: Documentation

Code scanning categorizes files by file path. You cannot manually categorize source files.

In this example, an alert is marked as in "Test" code in the code scanning alert list.

![Screenshot of an alert in the code scanning list. To the right of the title, a "Test" label is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-library-alert-index.png)

When you click through to see details for the alert, you can see that the file path is marked as "Test" code.
