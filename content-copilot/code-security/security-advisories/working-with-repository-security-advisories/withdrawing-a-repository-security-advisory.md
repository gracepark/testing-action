You can withdraw a repository security advisory that you've published.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note**: This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as a repository owner.

Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)."

</div>

If you publish a security advisory in error, you can withdraw the security advisory by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com).
