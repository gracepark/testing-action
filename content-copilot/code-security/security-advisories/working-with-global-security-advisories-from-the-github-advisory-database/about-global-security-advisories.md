## About global security advisories

There are two types of advisories: global security advisories and repository security advisories. For more information about repository security advisories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)."

Global security advisories are grouped into two categories: GitHub-reviewed advisories and unreviewed advisories.
- GitHub-reviewed advisories are security vulnerabilities that have been mapped to packages in ecosystems we support.
- Unreviewed advisories are security vulnerabilities that we publish automatically into the GitHub Advisory Database, directly from the National Vulnerability Database feed.

For more information about the GitHub Advisory Database, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-the-github-advisory-database)."

Security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories) are considered global advisories. Anyone can suggest improvements on any global security advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database. You can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted. The GitHub Security Lab curation team will review the submitted improvements and publish them onto the GitHub Advisory Database if accepted.

Every repository advisory is reviewed by the GitHub Security Lab curation team for consideration as a global advisory. We publish security advisories for any of the ecosystems supported by the dependency graph to the GitHub Advisory Database on [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories).

You can access any advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)."
