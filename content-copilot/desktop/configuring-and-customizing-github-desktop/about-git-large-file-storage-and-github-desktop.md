# About Git Large File Storage and GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop includes Git Large File Storage for managing large files.

When you install GitHub Desktop, Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) is installed, too. Git LFS lets you push files to GitHub that exceed the normal limit of 100 MiB. For more information about Git LFS, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)."

To use Git LFS with GitHub Desktop, you must configure Git LFS using the command line. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage)."

After you configure Git LFS to track files in a repository, you can seamlessly access and manage large files with GitHub Desktop like any other file in the repository.
