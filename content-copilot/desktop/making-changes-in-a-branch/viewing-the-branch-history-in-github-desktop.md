# Viewing the branch history in GitHub Desktop

You can see details about any commit in GitHub Desktop, including a diff of the changes the commit introduced.

Each commit shows:

- The commit message
- The time the commit was created
- The committer's username and profile photo (if available)
- The commit's SHA-1 hash (the unique ID)

1. In the left sidebar, click **History**.
