# Configuring notifications in GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop will keep you up-to-date with notifications about events that occur in your pull request branch.

## About notifications in GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop will show a system notification for events that occur in the currently selected repository. Notifications will be shown when:

- Pull request checks have failed.
- A pull request review is left with a comment, approval, or requested changes.

Clicking the notification will switch application focus to GitHub Desktop and provide more detailed information.

## Notifications about pull request check failures

When changes are made to a pull request branch, you will receive a system notification if the checks fail.

Clicking the notification will display a dialog with details about the checks. Once you've reviewed why the checks have failed, you can re-run the checks, or quickly switch to the pull request branch to get started on fixing the errors. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/viewing-and-re-running-checks-in-github-desktop)."

## Notifications for pull request reviews

GitHub Desktop will surface a system notification when a teammate has approved, commented, or requested changes in your pull request. See "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)" for more information on pull request reviews.

Clicking the notification will switch application focus to GitHub Desktop and provide more context for the pull request review comment.
