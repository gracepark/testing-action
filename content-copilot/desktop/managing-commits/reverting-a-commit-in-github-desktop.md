# Reverting a commit in GitHub Desktop

You can use GitHub Desktop to revert a specific commit to remove its changes from your branch.

When you revert to a previous commit, the revert is also a commit. The original commit also remains in the repository's history.

**Tip:** When you revert multiple commits, it's best to revert in order from newest to oldest. If you revert commits in a different order, you may see merge conflicts.
