If you are a network administrator, you can deploy GitHub Desktop to computers running Windows on an Active Directory-managed network by using the Windows Installer package file (`.msi`) with Group Policy or another remote installation system.

The Windows Installer package extracts the standalone installer (`.exe`) and configures Windows to install GitHub Desktop the next time a user signs in to their workstation. Users must have permissions to install GitHub Desktop in their user directory.

If a user runs the Windows Installer package for GitHub Desktop directly, to complete the installation, the user must sign out of their workstation and then sign back in.
