# Upgrading a sponsorship

You can upgrade your sponsorship to a higher tier.

## About sponsorship upgrades

When you upgrade your sponsorship tier, the change will become effective immediately. If you're starting a monthly sponsorship on behalf of your personal account, you'll immediately be charged a prorated amount for the time until your next regular billing date. If you're sponsoring on behalf of an organization, you can choose to pay the prorated amount or make the full monthly payment.

## Upgrading a sponsorship
