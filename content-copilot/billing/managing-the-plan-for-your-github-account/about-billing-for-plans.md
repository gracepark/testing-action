# About billing for plans

GitHub offers free and paid plans for every developer or team.

The bill for each account on GitHub consists of the account's plan, plus other any other subscriptions and usage-based billing for the account. This article discusses the "plan" component of your bill, specifically. For more information about the other components, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github)."

For more information about the plans available for your account, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

You can see pricing and a full list of features for each plan at https://github.com/pricing. GitHub does not offer custom products or plans.

You can choose monthly or yearly billing, and you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account)."

You can purchase other subscriptions and usage-based billing with your existing payment information. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github)."

Each account on GitHub is billed separately. Upgrading an organization account enables paid features for the organization's repositories only and does not affect the features available in repositories owned by any associated personal accounts. Similarly, upgrading a personal account enables paid features for the personal account's repositories only and does not affect the repositories of any organization accounts. For more information about account types, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

You must manage billing settings and paid features for each of your accounts separately. You can switch between settings for your personal account, organization accounts, and enterprise accounts using the context switcher on each settings page. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts)."
