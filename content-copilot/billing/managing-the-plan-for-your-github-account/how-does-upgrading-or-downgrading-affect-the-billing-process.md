# How does upgrading or downgrading affect the billing process?

When you upgrade the subscription for your personal account or organization, changes are applied immediately. When you downgrade your subscription, changes are applied at the end of your current billing cycle.

Changes to your paid personal account or organization subscription does not affect subscriptions or payments for other paid GitHub features, such as Git Large File Storage or paid apps purchased in GitHub Marketplace.
