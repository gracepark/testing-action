# Upgrading your account's plan

You can upgrade the plan for any type of account on GitHub.com at any time.

## About upgrades

Each account on GitHub is billed separately. Upgrading an organization account enables paid features for the organization's repositories only and does not affect the features available in repositories owned by any associated personal accounts. Similarly, upgrading a personal account enables paid features for the personal account's repositories only and does not affect the repositories of any organization accounts. For more information about account types, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

Upgrading your plan does not affect other subscriptions or usage-based billing for your account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github)."

## Upgrading your personal account's plan

You can upgrade your personal account from GitHub Free to GitHub Pro to get advanced code review tools on private repositories owned by your personal account.

Upgrading your personal account does not affect any organizations you may manage or repositories owned by those organizations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

## Managing your organization's plan

You can upgrade your organization's plan, add seats to your existing plan, or switch from per-repository to per-user pricing.

### Upgrading your organization's plan

You can upgrade your organization from GitHub Free for an organization to GitHub Team to access advanced collaboration and management tools for teams, or upgrade your organization to GitHub Enterprise Cloud for additional security, compliance, and deployment controls.

Upgrading an organization does not affect your personal account or repositories owned by your personal account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

Organization owners and billing managers can access or change billing settings for an organization.

### Next steps for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud

As part of your upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you set up an enterprise account on GitHub.com. An enterprise account allows you to manage multiple organizations. Optionally, you can set up identity and access management for an individual organization or enterprise account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/about-authentication-for-your-enterprise#authentication-through-githubcom-with-additional-saml-access-restriction)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

If you currently use GitHub Enterprise Cloud with a single organization, we encourage you to create an enterprise account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/creating-an-enterprise-account)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
