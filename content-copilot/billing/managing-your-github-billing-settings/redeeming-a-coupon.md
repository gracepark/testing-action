# Redeeming a coupon

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it towards a paid GitHub subscription.

GitHub can't issue a refund if you pay for an account before applying a coupon. We also can't transfer a redeemed coupon or give you a new coupon if you apply it to the wrong account. Confirm that you're applying the coupon to the correct account before you redeem a coupon.

If you use a coupon to pay for a subscription, when the coupon expires, your payment method will be charged the full cost of your subscription. If you do not have a saved payment method, your account will be downgraded to GitHub Free for personal accounts or GitHub Free for organizations.
