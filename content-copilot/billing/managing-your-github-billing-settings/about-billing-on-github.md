# About billing on GitHub

Your bill is a combination of charges for your subscriptions, including your account's plan, and usage-based billing.

## About billing on GitHub

GitHub bills separately for each account. This means that you will receive a separate bill for your personal account and for each organization or enterprise account you own. For more information about account types, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

You can switch between the billing settings for each of your accounts by using the context switcher. For more information, see "[Switching between settings for your different accounts](#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts)."

The bill for each account is a combination of subscriptions and usage-based billing. Subscriptions include your account's plan, such as GitHub Pro or GitHub Team, as well as paid products that have a consistent monthly cost, such as GitHub Copilot and apps from GitHub Marketplace.

Usage-based billing applies when the cost of a paid product depends on how much you use the product. For example, the cost of GitHub Actions depends on how many minutes your jobs spend running and how much storage your artifacts use.

Your plan may come with included amounts of usage-based products. For example, with GitHub Pro, your personal account gets 3,000 minutes of GitHub Actions usage for free each month. You can control usage beyond the included amounts by setting spending limits.

## Managing billing settings

You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your accounts separately. You can choose to pay monthly or yearly for each account. All subscriptions and usage-based billing associated with an account shares a billing date, payment method, and receipt.

You can pay for GitHub with a credit card or with a PayPal account. When you update the payment method for your account's plan, your new payment method is automatically added to your other subscriptions and usage-based billing.

For qualifying usage-based services, you may choose to pay for the services from your GitHub account or from an Azure subscription. The terms of the billing method you choose will apply to services billed in this manner.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings)."
