# Creating webhooks

You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events that occur on GitHub.

## About creating webhooks

You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events on GitHub that occur in a repository, organization,  GitHub Marketplace account,  GitHub Sponsors account,  or GitHub App.

For more information about the different types of webhooks, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/types-of-webhooks)."

For a complete list of webhook events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)."

## Creating a repository webhook

You can create a webhook to subscribe to events that occur in a specific repository. You must be a repository owner or have admin access in the repository to create webhooks in that repository.

You can use the GitHub web interface or the REST API to create a repository webhook. For more information about using the REST API to create a repository webhook, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/webhooks/repos#create-a-repository-webhook)."

1. Click **Add webhook**.
1. Under "Payload URL", type the URL where you'd like to receive payloads.
1. Optionally, select the **Content type** drop-down menu, and click a data format to receive the webhook payload in.
   - **application/json** will deliver the JSON payload directly as the body of the `POST` request.
   - **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** will send the JSON payload as a form parameter called `payload`.
1. Optionally, under "Secret", type a string to use as a `secret` key. You should choose a random string of text with high entropy. You can use the webhook secret to limit incoming requests to only those originating from GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/securing-your-webhooks)."
1. Under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?", select the webhook events that you want to receive. You should only subscribe to the webhook events that you need.
1. If you chose **Let me select individual events**, select the events that you want to trigger the webhook.
1. To make the webhook active immediately after adding the configuration, select **Active**.
1. Click **Add webhook**.

After you create a new webhook, GitHub will send you a simple `ping` event to let you know you've set up the webhook correctly. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#ping)."

## Creating an organization webhook

You can create a webhook to subscribe to events that occur in a specific organization. You must be an organization owner to create webhooks in that organization.

You can use the GitHub web interface or the REST API to create an organization webhook. For more information about using the REST API to create an organization webhook, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/webhooks#create-an-organization-webhook)."

## Creating webhooks for a GitHub App

The owner of a GitHub App can subscribe the app to webhook events to receive notifications whenever certain events occur. If an organization has designated any app managers for a GitHub App owned by the organization, the app managers can also subscribe the app to webhook events. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/using-webhooks-with-github-apps)."

Each GitHub App has one webhook. You can configure the webhook when you register a GitHub App, or you can edit the webhook configuration for an existing GitHub App registration.

For more information about configuring a webhook when you register a GitHub App, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)."

To configure a webhook for an existing GitHub App registration:

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo.
1. Navigate to your account settings.
   - For a GitHub App owned by a personal account, click **Settings**.
   - For a GitHub App owned by an organization:
     1. Click **Your organizations**.
     1. To the right of the organization, click **Settings**.
1.

1. Click **Save changes**.
1. In the sidebar, click **Permissions & events**.
1. The specific webhook events that you can select for your GitHub App registration are determined by the type of permissions you selected for your app. You will first need to select the permissions you would like your app to have, and then you can subscribe your app to webhook events that are related to that set of permissions.

   Under the sections "Repository permissions," "Organization permissions," and "Account permissions," select the permissions that are required for the events your app will subscribe to. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app)." For more information about things to consider when changing the permissions, see "[Modifying a GitHub App registration](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app-registration#changing-the-permissions-of-a-github-app)."
1. Under "Subscribe to Events," select the webhook events you would like your GitHub App to receive.
1. Click **Save changes**.

You can also use the REST API to create a webhook for a GitHub App. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/webhooks)."
