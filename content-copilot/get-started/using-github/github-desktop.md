GitHub Desktop extends and simplifies your Git and GitHub workflow using a visual interface.

## About GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a free, open source application that helps you to work with code hosted on GitHub or other Git hosting services. With GitHub Desktop, you can perform Git commands, such as committing and pushing changes, in a graphical user interface, rather than using the command line.
