# Attaching files

You can convey information by attaching a variety of file types to your issues and pull requests.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** For public repositories, uploaded files can be accessed without authentication.
In the case of private and internal repositories, only people with access to the repository can view the uploaded files.

</div>

To attach a file to an issue or pull request conversation, drag and drop it into the comment box. Alternatively, you can click the bar at the bottom of the comment box to browse, select, and add a file from your computer.

When you attach a file, it is uploaded immediately to GitHub and the text field is updated to show the anonymized URL for the file. For more information on anonymized URLs see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls)".

**Note:** To upload videos greater than 10MB to a repository owned by a user or organization on a paid GitHub plan, you must either be an organization member or outside collaborator, or be on a paid plan.

**Note:** Video codec compatibility is browser specific, and it's possible that a video you upload to one browser is not viewable on another browser. At the moment we recommend using h.264 for greatest compatibility.
