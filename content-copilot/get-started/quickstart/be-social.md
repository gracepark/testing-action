You can interact with people, repositories, and organizations on GitHub. See what others are working on and who they are connecting with from your personal dashboard.

**Who can use this feature**: 
To learn about accessing your personal dashboard, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

When you follow someone on GitHub, you will get notifications on your personal dashboard about their public activity. If someone you follow creates a new repository, stars a repository, or follows another user, the activity will display in your dashboard.

To follow someone, click **Follow** on a person's profile page.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people)."

## Watching a repository

You can subscribe to a repository to watch it and receive notifications for activity in it. When the owner updates the repository, you will see the changes in your personal dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions)."

## Joining the conversation

You can connect with developers around the world to ask and answer questions, learn, and interact directly with GitHub staff. To get the conversation started, see "[GitHub Community Support](https://github.community)."

## Communicating on GitHub

GitHub provides built-in collaborative communication tools, allowing you to interact closely with your community when building great software. For example, you can contribute to another user's project by creating a pull request, or use issues to track bugs or suggest ideas in a repository. You can also brainstorm new ideas with your team with discussions.

For an overview of these tools, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/quickstart/communicating-on-github)."

## Participating in organizations

Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can establish teams with special permissions, have a public organization profile, and keep track of activity within the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)."

From your dashboard, click the drop down menu of your username on the left side of your dashboard. Here, you can view organizations that you are a part of and easily switch between them.

## Exploring other projects on GitHub

You can discover new and interesting projects on GitHub's Explore page. You can star interesting projects to make them easy to find again later. Visit your stars page to see all your starred projects. For more information about stars, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars)."

Your dashboard feed displays projects based on your interests including repositories you star, people you follow, and your contributions to public repositories. From your dashboard, you can see trending projects, view topics, and check out collections.

To explore more projects, see "[Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore)".

## Next steps

You are now connected to the GitHub community. There are other ways to interact and build within GitHub.

- Synchronizing GitHub repositories with your computer allows you to work locally and push your changes to GitHub. For more information, see “[Set up Git](/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).”

- Creating a repository for your project allows you to store code in GitHub. This provides a backup of your work that you can choose to share with other developers. For more information, see “[Create a repository](/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)."

- Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the original. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."

- GitHub connects users and allows you to interact with other projects. To learn more about contributing to someone else's project, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)."

- GitHub has a great support community where you can ask for help and talk to people from around the world. Join the conversation on [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions).
