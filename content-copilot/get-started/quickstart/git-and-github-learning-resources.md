# Git and GitHub learning resources

There are a lot of helpful Git and GitHub resources on the web. This is a short list of our favorites!

## Using Git

Familiarize yourself with Git by visiting the [official Git project site](https://git-scm.com) and reading the [ProGit book](http://git-scm.com/book). You can also review the [Git command list](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## Using GitHub

GitHub Skills offers free interactive courses that are built into GitHub with instant automated feedback and help. Learn to open your first pull request, make your first open source contribution, create a GitHub Pages site, and more. For more information about course offerings, see [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/).

Become better acquainted with GitHub through our [getting started](/get-started) articles. See our [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) for a process introduction. Refer to our [overview guides](https://guides.github.com) to walk through basic concepts.

You can connect with developers around the world to ask and answer questions, learn, and interact directly with GitHub staff. To get the conversation started, see "[GitHub Community Support](https://github.community)."
