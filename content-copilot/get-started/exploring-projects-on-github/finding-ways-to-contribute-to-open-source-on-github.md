You can find ways to contribute to open source projects on GitHub.com that are relevant to you.

**Who can use this feature**: 
## Discovering relevant projects

If there's a particular topic that interests you, visit `github.com/topics/<topic>`. For example, if you are interested in machine learning, you can find relevant projects and good first issues by visiting https://github.com/topics/machine-learning. You can browse popular topics by visiting [Topics](https://github.com/topics). You can also search for repositories that match a topic you're interested in. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-by-topic)."

If you've been active on GitHub.com, you can find personalized recommendations for projects and good first issues based on your past contributions, stars, and other activities in [Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore).

Keep up with recent activity from repositories you watch, as well as people and organizations you follow, with your personal dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

You can connect with developers around the world to ask and answer questions, learn, and interact directly with GitHub staff. To get the conversation started, see "[GitHub Community Support](https://github.community)."

## Finding good first issues

If you already know what project you want to work on, you can find beginner-friendly issues in that repository by visiting `github.com/<owner>/<repository>/contribute`. For an example, you can find ways to make your first contribution to `electron/electron` at https://github.com/electron/electron/contribute.
