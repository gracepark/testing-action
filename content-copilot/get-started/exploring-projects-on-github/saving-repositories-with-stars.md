# Saving repositories with stars

You can star repositories and topics to keep track of projects you find interesting and discover related content in your news feed.

You can search, sort, and filter your starred repositories and topics on your [stars page](https://github.com/stars).

## About stars

Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your [stars page](https://github.com/stars).

You can star repositories and topics to discover similar projects on GitHub. When you star repositories or topics, GitHub may recommend related content on your personal dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#staying-updated-with-activity-from-the-community)."

Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of GitHub's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, [Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore) shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have.

## Starring a repository

Starring a repository is a simple two-step process.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Star**.

## Viewing who has starred a repository

You can view everyone who has starred a public repository or a private repository you have access to.

To view everyone who has starred a repository, add `/stargazers` to the end of the URL of a repository. For example, to view stargazers for the github/docs repository, visit https://github.com/github/docs/stargazers.

## Organizing starred repositories with lists

**Note:** Lists are currently in public beta and subject to change.

Curate repositories that you've starred with public lists. You can create public lists that appear on your stars page at `https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=stars`.

If you add a private repository to a list, then the private repository will only appear in your list for people with `read` access to the repository.

You can add a repository to an existing or new list wherever you see a repository's **Star** or **Starred** dropdown menu, whether on a repository page or in a list of starred repositories.
