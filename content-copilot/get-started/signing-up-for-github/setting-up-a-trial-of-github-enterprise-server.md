# Setting up a trial of GitHub Enterprise Server

You can try GitHub Enterprise Server for free.

## About trials of GitHub Enterprise Server

You can request a 45-day trial to evaluate GitHub Enterprise Server. Your trial will be installed as a virtual appliance, with options for on-premises or cloud deployment. For more information about GitHub Enterprise Server, and for a list of supported virtualization platforms, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server)."

Security alerts and GitHub Connect are not currently available in trials of GitHub Enterprise Server. For a demonstration of these features, contact [GitHub's Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact). For more information about these features, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/managing-github-connect)."

Trials are also available for GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud)."

If you're not sure whether GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or both are best for your organization, contact [GitHub's Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact). If your organization has 11 or fewer developers, consider GitHub Team; organizations with 12 or more developers typically benefit the most from GitHub Enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

GitHub Enterprise Server is installed as a virtual appliance. Determine the best person in your organization to set up a virtual machine, and ask that person to submit a [trial request](https://enterprise.github.com/trial). You can begin your trial immediately after submitting a request.
