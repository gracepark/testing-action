# Getting started with GitHub Team

With GitHub Team groups of people can collaborate across many projects at the same time in an organization account.

This guide will walk you through setting up, configuring and managing your GitHub Team account as an organization owner.

## Part 1: Configuring your account on GitHub.com

As the first steps in starting with GitHub Team, you will need to create a personal account or log into your existing account on GitHub, create an organization, and set up billing.

### 1. About organizations

Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features. For more information on the features of organizations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations#terms-of-service-and-data-protection-for-organizations)."

### 2. Creating an organization and signing up for GitHub Team

Before creating an organization, you will need to create a personal account or log in to your existing account on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)."

Once your personal account is set up, you can create an organization and pick a plan. This is where you can choose a GitHub Team subscription for your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)."

### 3. Managing billing for an organization

You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your personal accounts and organizations separately. You can switch between settings for your different accounts using the context switcher in your settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts)."

Your organization's billing settings page allows you to manage settings like your payment method, billing cycle and billing email, or view information such as your subscription, billing date and payment history. You can also view and upgrade your storage and GitHub Actions minutes. For more information on managing your billing settings, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings)."

Only organization members with the _owner_ or _billing manager_ role can access or change billing settings for your organization. A billing manager is someone  who manages the billing settings for your organization and does not use a paid license in your organization's subscription. For more information on adding a billing manager to your organization, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization)."

## Part 2: Adding members and setting up teams

After creating your organization, you can invite members and set permissions and roles. You can also create different levels of teams and set customized levels of permissions for your organization's repositories, project boards, and apps.

### 1. Managing members of your organization

You can invite anyone to be a member of your organization, as long as they have a personal account on GitHub. You can also remove members and reinstate former members. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization)."

### 2. Organization permissions and roles

Each person in your organization has a role that defines their level of access to the organization. The member role is the default, and you can assign owner and billing manager roles as well as "team maintainer" permissions. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

### 3. About and creating teams

Teams are groups of organization members that you can create to reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions. Organization members can send notifications to a team or request reviews, and teams can be visible or secret. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

You can create independent teams or have multiple levels of nested teams to reflect your group or company's hierarchy. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team)."

### 4. Managing team settings

You can designate a "team maintainer" to manage team settings and discussions, among other privileges. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/assigning-the-team-maintainer-role-to-a-team-member)."

You can manage code review assignments for your team, change team visibility, manage scheduled reminders for your team, and more in your team's settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams)."

### 5. Giving people and teams access to repositories, project boards and apps

You can give organization members, teams, and outside collaborators different levels of access to repositories owned by your organization with repository roles. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization)."

You can also customize access to your organization's project boards and allow individual organization members to manage your organization's GitHub Apps. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization)."

## Part 3: Managing security for your organization

You can help to make your organization more secure by recommending or requiring two-factor authentication for your organization members, configuring security features, and reviewing your organization's audit log and integrations.

### 1. Requiring two-factor authentication

You can view whether your organization members have two-factor authentication enabled and choose to require two-factor authentication in your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)."

### 2. Configuring security features for your organization

To keep your organization secure, you can use a variety of GitHub security features, including security policies, dependency graphs, secret scanning and Dependabot security and version updates. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)."

### 3. Reviewing your organization's audit log and integrations

The audit log for your organization allows you, as an organization owner, to review the actions performed by members of the organization within the current month and previous six months. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

You can also review and configure the permission levels for your organization's installed integrations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/reviewing-github-apps-installed-in-your-organization)."

## Part 4: Setting organization level policies

### 1. Managing organization policies

You can manage permissions and policies for a number of different actions and features in your organization.

For example, to protect your organization's data, you can restrict repository creation in your organization. You can also choose to allow or prevent the forking of private repositories owned by your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization)."

For the full list of settings you can configure for your organization, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings)."

### 2. Managing repository changes

You can configure permissions for creating, transferring and deleting repositories in your organization, including which types members can create. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/setting-permissions-for-deleting-or-transferring-repositories)."

You can also restrict or grant the ability to change repository visibility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-visibility-changes-in-your-organization)."

### 3. Using organization-level community health files and moderation tools

You can create default community health files, such as a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, or even issue and pull request templates, for your organization. These default files will be used for any repository owned by your organization that does not contain its own file of that type. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

GitHub offers multiple tools for moderating and managing your community. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-management-and-moderation#tools-for-moderating-your-community)."

## Part 5: Customizing and automating your work on GitHub

You can use tools from the GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub API, and existing GitHub features to customize and automate your work.
