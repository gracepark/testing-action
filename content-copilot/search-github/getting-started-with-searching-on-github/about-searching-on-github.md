# About searching on GitHub

Our integrated search covers the many repositories, users, and lines of code on GitHub.

## About searching on GitHub

You can search globally across all of GitHub, or scope your search to a particular repository or organization.

- To search globally across all of GitHub, type what you're looking for into the search field at the top of any page, and choose "Search all of GitHub" in the search dropdown menu.
- To search within a particular repository or organization, navigate to the repository or organization page, type what you're looking for into the search field at the top of the page, and press **Enter**.

**Notes:**

- You must be signed into a personal account on GitHub to search for code across all public repositories.
- GitHub Pages sites are not searchable on GitHub. However you can search the source content if it exists in the default branch of a repository, using code search. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code)." For more information about GitHub Pages, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)"
- Currently our search doesn't support exact matching.

After running a search on GitHub, you can sort the results, or further refine them by clicking one of the languages in the sidebar. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/sorting-search-results)."

GitHub search uses an ElasticSearch cluster to index projects every time a change is pushed to GitHub. Issues and pull requests are indexed when they are created or modified.

## Searching using a visual interface

In addition to the search bar, you can search GitHub using the [search](https://github.com/search) page or [advanced search](https://github.com/search/advanced) page. 

The [advanced search](https://github.com/search/advanced) page provides a visual interface for constructing search queries. You can filter your searches by a variety of factors, such as the number of stars or number of forks a repository has. As you fill in the advanced search fields, your query will automatically be constructed in the top search bar.

![Screenshot of the Advanced search page. The top search bar is filled in with the query "kittens user:octocat" and, under the "Advanced options" section below, the "From these owners" text box contains the term "octocat" and is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/search/advanced-search.png)

## Searching repositories on GitHub.com from your private enterprise environment

If you use both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub AE, and an enterprise owner has enabled unified search, you can search across both environments at the same time from GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub AE. For more information, see [the GitHub Enterprise Server documentation](/enterprise-server@latest/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github#searching-repositories-on-githubcom-from-your-private-enterprise-environment) or [the GitHub AE documentation](/github-ae@latest/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github#searching-repositories-on-githubcom-from-your-private-enterprise-environment).
