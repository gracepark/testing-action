# Finding files on GitHub

You can search for a file in a repository using the file finder. To search for a file in multiple repositories on GitHub, use the [`filename` code search qualifier](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code#search-by-filename).

**Tips:**

- By default, file finder results exclude some directories like `build`, `log`, `tmp`, and `vendor`. To search for files in these directories, use the [`filename` code search qualifier](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code#search-by-filename).
- You can also open the file finder by pressing `t` on your keyboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)."

## Using the file finder
