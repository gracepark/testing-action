# Closing a pull request

You may choose to *close* a pull request without [merging it into the upstream branch](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request). This can be handy if the changes proposed in the branch are no longer needed, or if another solution has been proposed in another branch.

**Tip**: If you opened a pull request with the wrong base branch, rather than closing it out and opening a new one, you can instead change the base branch. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request)."

1. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you'd like to close.
1. At the bottom of the pull request, below the comment box, click **Close pull request**.
1. Optionally, [delete the branch](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request). This keeps the list of branches in your repository tidy.
