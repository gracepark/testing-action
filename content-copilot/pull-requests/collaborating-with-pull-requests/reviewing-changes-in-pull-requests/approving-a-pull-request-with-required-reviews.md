# Approving a pull request with required reviews

If your repository requires reviews, pull requests must have a specific number of approving reviews from people with _write_ or _admin_ permissions in the repository before they can be merged.

For more information about required reviews, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging)."

You can comment on a pull request, approve the changes, or request improvements before approving. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)."

You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)."

**Tip**: If a pull request you approved has changed significantly, you can dismiss your review. The pull request will need a new review before it can be merged. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review)."

**Tips**:
- If a collaborator with `admin`, `owner`, or `write` access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request.
- Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.
- If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed. The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged.
- When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you wonâ€™t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.
- If your repository requires approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions, then any approvals from people with these permissions are denoted with a green check mark, and approvals from people without these permissions have a gray check mark. Approvals with a gray check mark do not affect whether the pull request can be merged.
- Pull request authors cannot approve their own pull requests.
