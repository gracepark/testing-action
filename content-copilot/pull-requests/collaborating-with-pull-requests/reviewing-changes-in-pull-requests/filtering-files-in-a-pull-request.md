# Filtering files in a pull request

To help you quickly review changes in a large pull request, you can filter changed files.

You can filter files in a pull request by file extension type, such as `.html` or `.js`, lack of an extension, code ownership, or dotfiles.

## Using the file filter dropdown

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tip:** To simplify your pull request diff view, you can also temporarily hide deleted files or files you have already viewed in the pull request diff from the file filter drop-down menu.
