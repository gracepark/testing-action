# Viewing a pull request review

You can view all of the comments made in a single pull request review.

You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)."

When you view a full review, you'll see the same version of the pull request as the reviewer did at the time of the review.
