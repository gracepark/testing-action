# Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization

Organizations can have more than one organization owner to avoid lapses in ownership.

**Who can use this feature**: Organization owners can promote any member of an organization to an organization owner.

## About maintaining ownership continuity for your organization

If an organization only has one owner, the organization's projects can become inaccessible if the owner is unreachable. To ensure that no one will lose access to a project, we recommend that at least two people within each organization have the owner role.

Organization owners have full administrative access to the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

**Note**: As an organization owner, you can change the role of other organization members and owners. You can't change your own role.
