# Removing organization members from a team

People with *owner* or *team maintainer* permissions can remove team members from a team. This may be necessary if a person no longer needs access to a repository the team grants, or if a person is no longer focused on a team's projects.

**Warning:**

- If you remove a personâ€™s access to a private repository, any of their forks of that private repository are deleted. Local clones of the private repository are retained. If a team's access to a private repository is revoked or a team with access to a private repository is deleted, and team members do not have access to the repository through another team, private forks of the repository will be deleted.
- You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property.

- People with admin permissions to a private repository can disallow forking of that repository, and organization owners can disallow forking of any private repository in an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-repository)."
