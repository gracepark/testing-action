# Best practices for organizations

Learn GitHub-recommended practices for your organization.

## Assign multiple owners

If an organization only has one owner, the organization's projects can become inaccessible if the owner is unreachable. To ensure that no one will lose access to a project, we recommend that at least two people within each organization have the owner role. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization)."

## Use teams

We recommend using teams to facilitate collaboration in your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

We recommend keeping teams visible whenever possible and reserving secret teams for sensitive situations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/changing-team-visibility)."
