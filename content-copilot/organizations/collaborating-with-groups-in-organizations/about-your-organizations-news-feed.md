An organization's news feed shows other people's activity on repositories owned by that organization. You can use your organization's news feed to see when someone opens, closes, or merges an issue or pull request, creates or deletes a branch, creates a tag or release, comments on an issue, pull request, or commit, or pushes new commits to GitHub.

## Accessing your organization's news feed

1. [Sign in](https://github.com/login) to your account on GitHub.com.
1. Open your [personal dashboard](https://github.com/dashboard).
1. In the upper-left corner of the page, select the dropdown menu that switches account context, then select an organization.
