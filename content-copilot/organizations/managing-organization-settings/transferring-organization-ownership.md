# Transferring organization ownership

To make someone else the owner of an organization account, you must add a new owner, ensure that the billing information is updated, and then remove yourself from the account.

1. If you're the only member with _owner_ privileges, give another organization member the owner role. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization#appointing-an-organization-owner)."
1. Contact the new owner and make sure they are able to [access the organization's settings](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/accessing-your-organizations-settings).

1. If you are currently responsible for paying for GitHub in your organization, you'll also need to have the new owner or a [billing manager](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization) update the organization's payment information. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/adding-or-editing-a-payment-method)."

   **Warning**: Removing yourself from the organization **does not** update the billing information on file for the organization account. The new owner or a billing manager must update the billing information on file to remove your credit card or PayPal information.
