# Upgrading to the GitHub Customer Agreement

Organizations can upgrade from the Standard Terms of Service to the GitHub Customer Agreement.

The Standard Terms of Service is an agreement between GitHub and you as an individual. To enter into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit, or group, organization owners can upgrade to the GitHub Customer Agreement.

You can upgrade to the GitHub Customer Agreement instead of using the Standard Terms of Service to help prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization)."
