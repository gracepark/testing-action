# Managing scheduled reminders for your organization

You can get reminders in Slack for all pull requests that teams in your organization have been requested to review.

## About scheduled reminders for pull requests

Scheduled reminders help teams focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to your team in Slack with all open pull requests that you or your team have been asked to review, at a specified time. For example, you can create a scheduled reminder to send a message to your team's main communication channel in Slack, including all open pull requests that the team is requested to review, every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

Organization owners can schedule a reminder for one or more teams in their organization, for all pull requests the team or teams have been requested to review.

GitHub will only trigger reminders for up to five repositories per owner and 20 pull requests per repository. Reminders are not sent when changes are merged from upstream into a fork.
