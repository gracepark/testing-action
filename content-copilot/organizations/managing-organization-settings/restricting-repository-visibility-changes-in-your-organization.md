# Restricting repository visibility changes in your organization

To protect your organization's data, you can configure permissions for changing repository visibility in your organization.

**Who can use this feature**: Organization owners can restrict repository visibility changes for an organization.

You can restrict who has the ability to change the visibility of repositories in your organization, such as changing a repository from private to public. For more information about repository visibility, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)."

You can restrict the ability to change repository visibility to organization owners only, or you can allow anyone with admin access to a repository to change visibility.

Restricting who has the ability to change the visibility of repositories in your organization helps prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-warning border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-danger-emphasis color-bg-danger">

**Warning**: If enabled, this setting allows people with admin access to choose any visibility for an existing repository, even if you do not allow that type of repository to be created. For more information about restricting the visibility of repositories during creation, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization)."
