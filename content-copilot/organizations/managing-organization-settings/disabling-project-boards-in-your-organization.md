# Disabling project boards in your organization

Organization owners can turn off organization-wide project boards and repository project boards in an organization.

After you disable organization-wide projects, it wonâ€™t be possible to create new projects at the organization level, and any existing organization-level projects will become inaccessible at their previous URLs.
