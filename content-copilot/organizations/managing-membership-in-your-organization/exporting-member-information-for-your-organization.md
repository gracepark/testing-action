# Exporting member information for your organization

You can export information about all of your organization's members from GitHub's web UI.

**Who can use this feature**: Organization owners can export member information for an organization.

## About export of membership information

You can export aggregated information about your organization's members as a report. For example, you may want to perform an audit of your organization's current members. You can generate a file containing the report from GitHub's web UI.

The membership information report includes the following information.

- Username and display name details
- Whether the user has two-factor authentication enabled
- Whether the membership is public or private
- Whether the user is an organization owner or member
- Datetime of the user's last activity (for a full list of relevant activity, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)")

You can also use GitHub's APIs to retrieve information about your organization's members. For more information, see the [GraphQL API](/graphql/reference/objects#user) and [REST API](/rest/users) documentation.

## Exporting a membership information report

You can download a CSV or JSON file containing the membership information report for your organization.
