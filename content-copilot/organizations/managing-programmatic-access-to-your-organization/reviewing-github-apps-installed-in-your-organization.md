# Reviewing GitHub Apps installed in your organization

Organization owners can review the GitHub Apps that are installed on their organization. They can view the permissions granted to the app and change the repositories that the GitHub App can access. They can also suspend or delete the GitHub App to prevent the app from accessing resources owned by the organization.
