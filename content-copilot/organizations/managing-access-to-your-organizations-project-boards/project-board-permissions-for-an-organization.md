# Project (classic) permissions for an organization

Organization owners and people with classic project admin permissions can customize who has read, write, and admin permissions to your organizationâ€™s classic projects.

## Permissions overview

There are three levels of permissions to a classic project for people and teams:

- **Read**, which gives people permission to view a classic project.
- **Write**, which gives people permission to view a classic project, link repositories to a classic project, and interact with a classic project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board)."
- **Admin**, which gives people permission to view a classic project, interact with a classic project, manage classic project settings, and manage other people's access to the classic project.

Organization owners and people with admin permissions can give a person access to an organization classic project individually, as an outside collaborator or organization member, or through their membership in a team or organization. An outside collaborator is someone who is not an organization member but given permissions to collaborate in your organization.

Organization owners and people with admin permissions to a classic project can also:
- Set default project board permissions for all organization members.
- Manage access to the project board for organization members, teams, and outside collaborators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-project-board)", "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-project-board)", or "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members)."
- Manage project board visibility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members)."

## Cascading permissions for classic projects

If a person has multiple avenues of access to an organization classic project (individually, through a team, or as an organization member), the highest classic project permission level overrides lower permission levels.

For example, if an organization owner has given all organization members read permissions to a classic project, and a classic project admin gives an organization member write permissions to that board as an individual collaborator, that person would have write permissions to the classic project.

## Classic project visibility

By default, user-owned and organization-wide classic projects are private and only visible to people with read, write, or admin permissions to the classic project. A public classic project is visible to anyone with the classic project's URL. Repository-level classic projects share the visibility of their repository. That is, a private repository will have a private project, and this visibility cannot be changed. You can change the classic project's visibility from private to public and back again.
