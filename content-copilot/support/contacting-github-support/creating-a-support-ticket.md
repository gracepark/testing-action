# Creating a support ticket

You can use the GitHub Support portal to create a support ticket and speak to GitHub Support.

## About support tickets

If your account uses a paid GitHub product or you are a member of an organization that uses a paid product, you can directly contact GitHub Support. If your account uses GitHub Free, you can speak to GitHub users and staff on the [GitHub Community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions) for most issues, and you can contact GitHub Support to report account, security, and abuse issues.

After you create your ticket, you can view your ticket and the responses from GitHub Support on the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/support/contacting-github-support/viewing-and-updating-support-tickets)."

## What to include in your support ticket

Providing GitHub Support with everything they need to understand, locate, and reproduce an issue will allow for a faster resolution and less back-and-forth between yourself and the support team. To ensure GitHub Support can assist you, consider the following points when you write your ticket:

- Obtain information that can help GitHub Support track, prioritize, reproduce, or investigate the issue.
- Include full URLs, repository names, and usernames wherever possible.
- Reproduce the issue if applicable and be prepared to share the steps.
- Be prepared to provide a full description of the issue and expected results.
- Copy exact wording of all error messages related to your issue.
- Determine if there is an existing ticket number in any ongoing communications with GitHub Support.
- Include relevant logs and attach any screenshots that demonstrate the issue.
