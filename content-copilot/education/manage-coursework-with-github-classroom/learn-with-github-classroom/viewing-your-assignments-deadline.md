# Viewing your assignment's deadline

You can view the deadline for an assignment at any time through the README of your assignment repository.

## About assignment deadlines

Your teacher can set an assignment deadline for assignments on GitHub Classroom. If your teacher makes a deadline a hard cutoff, unless you or your group have received an extension, you will lose write access to your assignment repository after the deadline passes. You can easily monitor the deadline for an assignment through the README in your assignment repository.
