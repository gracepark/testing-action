# Leave feedback with pull requests

You can leave feedback for your students in a special pull request within the repository for each assignment.

**Who can use this feature**: People with read permissions to a repository can leave feedback in a pull request for the repository.
## About feedback pull requests for assignments

You can automatically create a pull request where you can provide feedback and answer a student's questions about an assignment. For more information about the review of changes in a pull request, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests)."

When you enable the pull request for feedback for an assignment, GitHub Classroom will create a special pull request titled **Feedback** in the assignment repository for each student or team. The pull request automatically shows every commit that a student pushed to the assignment repository's default branch.

## Prerequisites

To create and access the feedback pull request, you must enable the feedback pull request when you create the assignment. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-a-group-assignment)."
