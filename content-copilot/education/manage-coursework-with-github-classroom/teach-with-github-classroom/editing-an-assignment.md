## About editing assignments

After creating an assignment, you can edit many aspects of the assignment to better fit the needs of yourself and your students. Be aware that you cannot change the assignment type (either individual or group) or the online integrated development environment (IDE) after assignment creation. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-a-group-assignment)."
