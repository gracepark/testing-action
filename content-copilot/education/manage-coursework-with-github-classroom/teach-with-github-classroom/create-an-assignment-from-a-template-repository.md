# Create an assignment from a template repository

You can create an assignment from a template repository to provide starter code, documentation, and other resources to your students.

**Who can use this feature**: Organization owners who are admins for a classroom can create an assignment from a template repository that is public or owned by the organization. For more information on classroom admins, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms#about-management-of-classrooms)."
You can use a template repository on GitHub as starter code for an assignment on GitHub Classroom. Your template repository can contain boilerplate code, documentation, and other resources for your students. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)."

To use the template repository for your assignment, the template repository must be owned by your organization, or the visibility of the template repository must be public.

You can reuse an existing assignment, even if it uses a template repository, in any other classroom that you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment)."
