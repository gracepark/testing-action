# Managing your submissions to GitHub Community Exchange

You can manage the purpose, topics, and offers assigned to each of your repositories in the GitHub Community Exchange gallery, or delete your repository submissions.

## About your submissions

During the GitHub Community Exchange submission process, you will choose a purpose, topics, and offers for your repository. Once a repository has been submitted to GitHub Community Exchange, it will be published with these details. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/contribute-with-github-community-exchange/submitting-your-repository-to-github-community-exchange)."

After you've submitted, you can still edit the topics and offers associated with your repository. You can also update the purpose of your repository by changing the corresponding topic(s). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)."

The language associated with your repository is the primary language used and is automatically determined by GitHub. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-repository-languages)."

The GitHub Community Exchange community moderates all repository submissions.
