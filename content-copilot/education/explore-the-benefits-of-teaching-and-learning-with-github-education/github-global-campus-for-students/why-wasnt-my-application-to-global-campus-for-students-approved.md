If you have other questions or concerns about the school domain please ask your school IT staff to contact us.

## Academic email address already used

If your academic email address was already used to request a GitHub Student Developer Pack for a different GitHub account, you cannot reuse the academic email address to successfully apply for another GitHub Student Developer Pack.

**Note:** It is against the GitHub [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements) to maintain more than one individual account.

</div>

If you have more than one personal account, you must merge your accounts. To retain the discount, keep the account that was granted the discount. You can rename the retained account and keep your contribution history by adding all your email addresses to the retained account.

## Ineligible student status

You're ineligible for a GitHub Student Developer Pack if:
- You're enrolled in an informal learning program that is not part of the [GitHub Campus Program](https://education.github.com/schools) and not enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study.
- You're pursuing a degree which will be terminated in the current academic session.
- You're under 13 years old.

Your instructor may still apply for a GitHub Education discount for classroom use. If you're a student at a coding school or bootcamp, you will become eligible for a GitHub Student Developer Pack if your school joins the [GitHub Campus Program](https://education.github.com/schools).
