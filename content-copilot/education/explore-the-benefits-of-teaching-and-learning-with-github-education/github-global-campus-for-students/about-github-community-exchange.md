## About GitHub Community Exchange

GitHub Community Exchange is a student community within the GitHub Global Campus portal. As a student, it's a place where you can get exposure for your project and discover other student repositories in need of collaborators and maintainers.

GitHub Community Exchange allows you to:
- Discover student created repositories
- Star repositories of interest
- Submit a repository in need of collaborators
- Submit a repository to teach new skills
- Manage your repository submissions
