# Quickstart for GitHub Educators

In about 15 minutes, teachers can get started with discounts, training, and tools for GitHub, then create a classroom for the students in a software development course using GitHub Classroom.

## Introduction

Educators who teach a course on software development can use discounts, partnerships, training, and tools from GitHub Education to effectively teach relevant skills to students.

In this guide, you'll get started with GitHub, sign up for accounts and discounted services through GitHub Education, and create a space for your course and assignment on GitHub Classroom.
