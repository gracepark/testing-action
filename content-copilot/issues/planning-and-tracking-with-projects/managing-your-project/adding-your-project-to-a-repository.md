# Adding your project to a repository

You can add your project to a repository to make it accessible from that repository.

You can list relevant projects in a repository. You can only list projects that are owned by the same user or organization that owns the repository.

In order for repository members to see a project listed in a repository, they must have visibility for the project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-visibility-of-your-projects)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects)."
