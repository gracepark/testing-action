# Configuring charts

Learn how to configure your charts and filter data from your project.

**Who can use this feature**: People with write or admin access to a project can use Insights.
Insights is available for the new Projects experience, you cannot use Insights with projects (classic). Historical charts are available with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud for organizations. You can save unlimited charts in private projects with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud for organizations and GitHub Pro for users. Users and organizations using a public project can also save unlimited charts. Users and organizations using GitHub Free or a legacy plan can save two charts in private projects.
