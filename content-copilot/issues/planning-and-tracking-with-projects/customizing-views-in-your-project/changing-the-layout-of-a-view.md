# Changing the layout of a view

You can view your project as a high-density table or as a kanban board.

## About the table layout

The table layout is a powerful and adaptable spreadsheet comprised of your issues, pull requests, and draft issues with metadata from GitHub and the custom fields you've added to your project.  You can group, sort, and filter items, and show or hide fields in your table layouts to suit the needs of everyone on your team. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout)."

## About the board layout

The board layout spreads your issues, pull requests, and draft issues across customizable columns. You can create a kanban board by setting your column field to a "Status" field or set any other single select or iteration field as the column field.

You can drag items from column to column and the value of the item will adjust to match the column you drag them to. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout)."
