## Adding issues and pull requests to a project

You have several options for adding issues and pull requests to your project. You can add them individually or in bulk. Furthermore, you can include issues and pull requests from any organization, and you also have the ability to add draft issues that can be converted into regular issues later on. For more information, see "[Creating draft issues](#creating-draft-issues).

### Pasting the URL of an issue or pull request

You can copy the URL of an issue or pull request into your clipboard and paste that into your project.

1. Place your cursor in the bottom row of the project, next to the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Create new item or add existing item" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg>.

## Creating draft issues

Draft issues are useful to quickly capture ideas. Unlike issues and pull requests that are referenced from your repositories, draft issues exist only in your project.

1. Place your cursor in the bottom row of the project, next to the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Create new item or add existing item" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg>.

   ![Screenshot showing the bottom row of a table view. The "Add item" field is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/add-item.png)
1. Type your idea, then press **Enter**.
1. To add body text, click on the title of the draft issue. In the markdown input box that appears, enter the text for the draft issue body, then click **Save**.

Draft issues can have a title, text body, assignees, and any custom fields from your project. In order to populate the repository, labels, or milestones for a draft issue, you must first convert the draft issue to an issue. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/converting-draft-issues-to-issues)."

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note**: Users will not receive notifications when they are assigned to or mentioned in a draft issue unless the draft issue is converted to an issue.
