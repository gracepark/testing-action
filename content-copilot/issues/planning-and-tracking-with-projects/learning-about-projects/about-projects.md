# About Projects

Projects is an adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub.

## About Projects

A project is an adaptable spreadsheet, task-board, and road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your team’s needs and processes.

### Staying up-to-date

Your projects are built from the issues and pull requests you add, creating direct references between your project and your work. Information is synced automatically to your project as you make changes, updating your views and charts. This integration works both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or issue in your project, the pull request or issue reflects that information. For example, change an assignee in your project and that change is shown in your issue. You can take this integration even further, group your project by assignee, and make changes to issue assignment by dragging issues into the different groups.

### Adding metadata to your items

You can use custom fields to add metadata to your issues, pull requests, and draft issues and build a richer view of item attributes. You’re not limited to the built-in metadata (assignee, milestone, labels, etc.) that currently exists for issues and pull requests. For example, you can add the following metadata as custom fields:

- A date field to track target ship dates.
- A number field to track the complexity of a task.
- A single select field to track whether a task is Low, Medium, or High priority.
- A text field to add a quick note.
- An iteration field to plan work week-by-week, including support for breaks.

### Automating your projects

You can  use the GraphQL API and GitHub Actions to take  control of your project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-api-to-manage-projects)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/automating-projects-using-actions)."

### Viewing your project from different perspectives

Quickly answer your most pressing questions by tailoring your project view to give you the information you need. You can save these views, allowing you to quickly return to them as needed and make them available to your team. Views not only let you scope down the items listed but also offer two different layout options.

You can view your project as a high-density table layout or a kanban board. For more information about the different layout options, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view)."
