# Managing tasks in a tasklist

You can track issues and pull requests as subtasks in a tasklist. You can also add draft tasks and later convert them into issues.

**Note:** Tasklists are in private beta and subject to change. We have currently paused onboarding to the beta.

## Adding tasks to a tasklist

You can add draft tasks, issues, and pull requests to a tasklist. Draft tasks are useful for quickly capturing ideas that you can later convert into issues. Unlike issues and pull requests that are referenced from your repositories, draft tasks exist only in your tasklist.

You can add issues and pull requests from any repository you have access to. People who do not have access to the issues and pull requests you add to your tasklist will just see the issue or pull request URL.

1. At the bottom of your tasklist, click **Add item to Tasks**.

1. Add your draft task, issue, or pull request.

   - To add a draft task, just type your task and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - To add a recently updated issue, click an issue from the list, or use your arrow keys to select it and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - To search for an issue in the current repository, start typing the title of an issue or the issue's number and click on the result, or use your arrow keys to select it and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   - To add an issue directly using its URL, paste the URL of an issue and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## Converting draft tasks to issues in a tasklist
