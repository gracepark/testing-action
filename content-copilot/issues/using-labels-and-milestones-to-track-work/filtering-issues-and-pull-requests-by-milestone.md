# Filtering issues and pull requests by milestone

Issues and pull requests can be filtered based on the milestone they're associated with. Once you've [associated an issue or pull request with a milestone](/articles/associating-milestones-with-issues-and-pull-requests), you can find items based on their milestones. Within a milestone, you can prioritize issues and pull requests.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tips:**

- If you'd rather filter issues and pull requests using the Search bar, you can use the milestone search syntax. For a milestone called My Milestone, the search syntax would be: `milestone:"My Milestone"`.
- To clear your filter selection, click **Clear current search query, filters, and sorts**.
- You can also filter issues or pull requests using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see "[`gh issue list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_list)" or "[`gh pr list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_list)" in the GitHub CLI documentation.
