# Adding notes to a project (classic)

You can add notes to a classic project to serve as task reminders or to add information related to the classic project.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tips:**
- You can format your note using Markdown syntax. For example, you can use headings, links, task lists, or emoji. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)."
- You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder notes and move them between columns. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Project boards" in "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#project-boards)."
- Your classic project must have at least one column before you can add notes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/creating-a-project-board)."

When you add a URL for an issue, pull request, or another classic project to a note, you'll see a preview in a summary card below your text.

## Converting a note to an issue

If you've created a note and find that it isn't sufficient for your needs, you can convert it to an issue.

When you convert a note to an issue, the issue is automatically created using the content from the note. The first line of the note will be the issue title and any additional content from the note will be added to the issue description.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Tip:** You can add content in the body of your note to @mention someone, link to another issue or pull request, and add emoji. These GitHub Flavored Markdown features aren't supported within classic project notes, but once your note is converted to an issue, they'll appear correctly. For more information on using these features, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)."
