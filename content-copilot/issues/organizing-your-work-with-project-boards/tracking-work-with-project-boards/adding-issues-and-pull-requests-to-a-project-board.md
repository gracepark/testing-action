# Adding issues and pull requests to a project (classic)

You can add issues and pull requests to a classic project in the form of cards and triage them into columns.

You can add issue or pull request cards to your classic project by:
- Dragging cards from the **Triage** section in the sidebar.
- Typing the issue or pull request URL in a card.
- Searching for issues or pull requests in the classic project search sidebar.

You can put a maximum of 2,500 cards into each project column. If a column has reached the maximum number of cards, no cards can be moved into that column.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** You can also add notes to your project board to serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any repository on GitHub, or to add related information to your classic project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-notes-to-a-project-board)."

</div>

You can view and make lightweight edits to issues and pull requests within your classic project by clicking on the issue or pull request's title.

You can link up to twenty-five repositories to your organization or user-owned classic project. Linking repositories makes it easier to add issues and pull requests from those repositories to your classic project using **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> Add cards** or from the issue or pull requests sidebar. When you search for issues and pull requests to add to your classic project, the search automatically scopes to your linked repositories. You can remove these qualifiers to search within all organization repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board)."

## Adding issues and pull requests to a classic project

1. Navigate to the classic project where you want to add issues and pull requests.
1. In your classic project, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> **Add cards**.

1. Search for issues and pull requests to add to your classic project using search qualifiers such as `is:issue is:open`. For more information on search qualifiers you can use, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)."

   <div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

   **Tips:**
   - You can also add an issue or pull request by typing the URL in a card.
   - If you're working on a specific feature, you can apply a label to each related issue or pull request for that feature, and then easily add cards to your classic project by searching for the label name. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)."

   </div>
1. From the filtered list of issues and pull requests, drag the card you'd like to add to your classic project and drop it in the correct column. Alternatively, you can move cards using keyboard shortcuts. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Project boards" in "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#project-boards)."

    <div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-tip border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

    **Tip:** You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards and move them between columns. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Project boards" in "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts#project-boards)."
