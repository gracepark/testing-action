# Reopening a closed project (classic)

You can reopen a closed classic project and restart any workflow automation that was configured for the classic project.

When you close a classic project, any workflow automation that was configured for the classic project will pause by default. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/closing-a-project-board)."

When you reopen a classic project, you have the option to _sync_ automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the board.

1. Navigate to the classic project you want to reopen.
1. On the top-right side of the classic project, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-three-bars" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M1 2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 1.75 2h12.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H1.75A.75.75 0 0 1 1 2.75Zm0 5A.75.75 0 0 1 1.75 7h12.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H1.75A.75.75 0 0 1 1 7.75ZM1.75 12h12.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H1.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5Z"></path></svg> **Menu**.
