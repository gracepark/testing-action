# Copying a project (classic)

You can copy a classic project to quickly create a new project. Copying frequently used or highly customized classic projects helps standardize your workflow.

Copying a classic project allows you to reuse a classic project's title, description, and automation configuration. You can copy classic projects to eliminate the manual process of creating new classic projects for similar workflows.

You must have read access to a classic project to copy it to a repository or organization where you have write access.

When you copy a classic project to an organization, the classic project's visibility will default to private, with an option to change the visibility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/changing-project-board-visibility)."

A classic project's automation is also enabled by default. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-automation-for-project-boards)."
