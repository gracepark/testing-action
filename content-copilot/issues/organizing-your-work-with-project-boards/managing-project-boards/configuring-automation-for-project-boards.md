# Configuring automation for projects (classic)

You can set up automatic workflows to move issues and pull requests to a classic project column when a specified event occurs.

To set up automatic workflows for a repository classic project, you must have write access to the repository. Organization owners and members can configure automatic workflows on an organization-wide classic project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-automation-for-project-boards)."

You can use a classic project template to create a classic project with automation already configured. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards#templates-for-project-boards)."

When you close a classic project, any workflow automation configured for the classic project will pause. If you reopen a classic project, you have the option to sync automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/reopening-a-closed-project-board)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/closing-a-project-board)."
