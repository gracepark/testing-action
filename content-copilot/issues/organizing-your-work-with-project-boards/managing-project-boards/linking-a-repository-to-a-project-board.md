# Linking a repository to a project (classic)

You can link a repository to your organization's or personal account's classic project.

Anyone with write permissions to a classic project can link repositories owned by that organization or personal account to the classic project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-project-board-owned-by-a-personal-account)."

You can link up to twenty-five repositories to your organization or user-owned classic project. Linking repositories makes it easier to add issues and pull requests from those repositories to your classic project using **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> Add cards** or from the issue or pull requests sidebar. You can add issues and pull requests from any unlinked repositories by typing the issue or pull request URL in a card.

**Note:** In order to link a repository to your organization or user owned classic project the repository needs to have issues enabled. That is, the repository has an "Issues" tab (in forked repositories issues are disabled by default).  For information on how to enable or disable issues for a repository, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/disabling-issues)."
