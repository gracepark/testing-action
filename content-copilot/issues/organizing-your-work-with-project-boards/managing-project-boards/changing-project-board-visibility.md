# Changing project (classic) visibility

As an organization owner or classic project admin, you can make a classic project public or private.

By default, user-owned and organization-wide classic projects are private and only visible to people with read, write, or admin permissions to the classic project. A public classic project is visible to anyone with the classic project's URL. Repository-level classic projects share the visibility of their repository. That is, a private repository will have a private project, and this visibility cannot be changed.

<div class="ghd-spotlight ghd-spotlight-note border rounded-1 my-3 p-3 f5 color-border-accent-emphasis color-bg-accent">

**Note:** When you make your classic project public, organization members are given read access by default. You can give specific organization members write or admin permissions by giving access to teams they're on or by adding them to the classic project as a collaborator. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."
