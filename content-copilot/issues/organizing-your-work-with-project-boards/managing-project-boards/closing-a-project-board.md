# Closing a project (classic)

If you've completed all the tasks in a classic project or no longer need to use a classic project, you can close the classic project.

When you close a classic project, any configured workflow automation will pause by default.

If you reopen a classic project, you have the option to _sync_ automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the board. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/reopening-a-closed-project-board)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-automation-for-project-boards)."

1. Navigate to the list of classic projects in your repository or organization, or owned by your personal account.
1. In the projects list, next to the classic project you want to close, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Project menu" role="img"><path d="M8 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3ZM1.5 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Zm13 0a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Z"></path></svg>.
