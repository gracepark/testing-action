# Viewing all of your issues and pull requests

The Issues and Pull Request dashboards list the open issues and pull requests you've created. You can use them to update items that have gone stale, close them, or keep track of where you've been mentioned across all repositoriesâ€”including those you're not subscribed to.

Your issue and pull request dashboards are available at the top of any page. On each dashboard, you can filter the list to find issues or pull requests you created, that are assigned to you, or in which you're mentioned. You can also find pull requests that you've been asked to review.

1. At the top of any page, click **Pull requests** or **Issues**.
