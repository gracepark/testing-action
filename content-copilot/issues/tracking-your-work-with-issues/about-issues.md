# About issues

Use GitHub Issues to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

## Integrated with GitHub

Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes.

For more information on keywords, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)."

## Quickly create issues

Issues can be created in a variety of ways, so you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. For example, you can create an issue from a repository, an item in a task list, a note in a project, a comment in an issue or pull request, a specific line of code, or a URL query. You can also create an issue from your platform of choice: through the web UI, GitHub Desktop, GitHub CLI, GraphQL and REST APIs, or GitHub Mobile. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)."

## Track work

You can organize and prioritize issues with projects. To track issues as part of a larger issue, you can use task lists. To categorize related issues, you can use labels and milestones.

For more information about projects, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards)." For more information about task lists, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)." For more information about labels and milestones, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work)."

## Stay up to date

To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can subscribe to an issue to receive notifications about the latest comments. To quickly find links to recently updated issues you're subscribed to, visit your dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/about-notifications)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

## Community management

To help contributors open meaningful issues that provide the information that you need, you can use issue forms and issue templates. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests)."

To maintain a healthy community, you can report comments that violate GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam)."

## Efficient communication

You can @mention collaborators who have access to your repository in an issue to draw their attention to a comment. To link related issues in the same repository, you can type `#` followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link. To communicate responsibility, you can assign issues. If you find yourself frequently typing the same comment, you can use saved replies.
