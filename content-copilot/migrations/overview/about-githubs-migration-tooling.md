# About GitHub's migration tooling

GitHub provides a variety of different tooling options to support migrations to GitHub and between GitHub products.

If you're moving between GitHub products, such as from GitHub Enterprise Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or from another code hosting platform, such as Bitbucket Server or GitLab, to GitHub, you'll want to bring your work with you: your code, the code's history, and all of your past conversations and collaboration.

GitHub provides a variety of different tools to support these migrations. Different tools support different migration pathways and provide different levels of migration fidelity.

Some tools, like GitHub Enterprise Importer migrate the current state of your code, all of the code's history, plus your settings and collaboration history, such as issues and pull requests. Other tools migrate only your code and its history, or even the code alone.

To determine the best tool for your migration and learn how to make your migration successful, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/overview/planning-your-migration-to-github)."
